What excuses have you to offer, my heart, for so many short-comings? Such constancy on the part of the Beloved, such un-faithfulness on your own!So much generosity on his side, on yours such niggling con-trariness! So many graces from him, so many faults committedby you!Such envy, such evil imaginings and dark thoughts in yourheart, such drawing, such tasting, such munificence by him!Why all this tasting? That your bitter soul may becomesweet. Why all this drawing? That you may join the companyof the saints. You are repentant of your sins, you have the name of Godon your lips; in that moment he draws you on, so that he maydeliver you alive.You are fearful at last of your wrongdoings, you seek desper-ately a way to salvation; in that instant why do you not see byyour side him who is putting such fear into your heart?  If he has bound up your eyes, you are like a pebble in hishand; now he rolls you along like this, now he tosses you inthe air.Now he implants in your nature a passion tor silver and goldand women; now he implants in your soul the light of the formof Mustafa.On this side drawing you towards the lovely ones, on thatside drawing you to the unlovely; amid these whirlpools theship can only pass through or founder.Offer up so many prayers, weep so sorely in the night season,that the echo may reach your ears from the sphere of the sevenheavens.When Shu‘aib’s groaning and lamentation and tears likehailstones passed beyond all bounds, in the morning a procla-mation came to him from heaven:“If you are a sinner, I have forgiven you and granted youpardon for your sins. Is it paradise you seek? Lo, I have given itto you; be silent, cease these petitions!”Shu‘aib retorted, “I seek neither this nor that. What I desireis to see God face to face; though the seven seas all turn to fire,I will plunge therein if only I may encounter Him.But if I am banished from that spectacle, if my tear-stainedeyes are shut against that vision, I am more fit to dwell in hell-fire; paradise becomes me not.Without His countenance, paradise for me is hateful hell. Iam consumed by this hue and scent of mortality; where is thesplendour of the lights of immortality?”They said, “At least moderate your weeping, lest your sightbe diminished, for the eye becomes blind when weeping passesbeyond bounds.”He said, “If my two eyes in the end should be seeing afterthat fashion, every part of me will become an eye: why thenshould I grieve over blindness?But if in the end this eye of mine should be deprived forever,let that sight indeed become blind which is unworthy to beholdthe Beloved!”  In this world, every man would become a ransom for his be-loved; one man’s beloved is a bag of blood, another’s the sunin splendour.Since every man has chosen a beloved, good or bad, as suitshis own nature, it would be a pity if we should annihilate our-selves tor the sake of nothing!One day a traveller was accompanying Ba Yazld on a certainroad. Presently Ba Yazld said to him, “What trade have youchosen, you rogue?”The man replied, “I am an ass-driver.” Ba Yazld exclaimed,“Be gone from me! — Lord, grant that his ass may die, that hemay become the slave of God!”O lovers, lovers, this day you and we are fallen into a whirl-pool: who knows how to swim?Though the world’s torrent should overflow and every wavebecome like a dromedary, why shall the waterfowl worry? It isthe bird of the air that should be anxious.Our faces are lighted up with gratitude, schooled as we are inwave and sea, inasmuch as ocean and flood are life-increasing tothe fish.Elder, hand us a towel; water, let us plunge into you; Mosesson of ‘Imran, come, smite the water of the sea with your staff!This wind concocts in every head a different passion; let mypassion be for yonder cupbearer, and you may have all the rest!Yesterday yon saki on the way snatched the caps of thedrunkards; today he is giving yet more wine, preparing to stripus of our robes.O envy of the Moon and of Jupiter, with us, yet hidden fromsight like a peri, gendy, gently you are drawing me on — will younot say whither?Wherever you go, you are with me still, you who are myeyes and my brightness; if you will, draw me to drunkenness,  if you will, transport me to annihilation.Know that the world is like Mount Sinai, and we like Mosesare seekers; every moment an epiphany arrives and cleaves themountain asunder.One portion becomes green, one portion becomes narcissus-white; one portion becomes a pearl, one portion ruby andamber.You who seek to behold Him, gaze upon this mountainchainof His. O mountain, what wind has blown upon you? We havebecome intoxicated with the echo.O gardener, gardener, why have you come to grapple withus? If we have carried off your grapes, you have carried off ourpurse!Today I beheld the beloved, that ornament of every affair; hewent off departing to heaven like the spirit of Mustafa.The sun is put to shame by his countenance, heaven’s sphereis as confused as the heart; through his glow, water and clay aremore resplendent than fire.I said, “Show me the ladder, that I may mount up toheaven.” He said, “Your head is the ladder; bring your headdown under your feet.”When you place your feet on your head, you will place yourfeet on the head of the stars; when you cleave through the air,set your foot on the air, so, and come!A hundred ways to heaven’s air become manifest to you; yougo flying up to heaven every dawning like a prayer.  Every instant a revelation from heaven comes to men’s inner-most souls: “How long like dregs do you remain upon earth?Come up!”Whoever is heavy of soul in the end proves to be dregs; onlythen does he mount to the top of the vat when his dregs areclarified.Do not stir the clay every moment, so that your water maybecome clear, so that your dregs may be illumined, so that yourpains may be cured.It is spiritual, like a torch, only its smoke is greater than itslight; when its smoke passes beyond bounds, it no longer dis-plays radiance in the house. If you diminish the smoke, you will enjoy the light of thetorch; both this abode and that will become illumined by yourlight.If you look into muddy water, you see neither the moon northe sky; sun and moon both disappear when darkness possessesthe air.A northern breeze is blowing, through which the air be-comes clarified; it is for the sake of this burnishing that at dawnthe zephyr breathes.The spiritual breeze burnishes the breast of all sorrow; letthe breath be stopped but for a moment, and annihilation willcome upon the spirit.The soul, a stranger in the world, is yearning for the city ofplacelessness; why, O why does the bestial spirit continue solong to graze?io Pure, goodly soul, how long will you journey on? You arethe King’s falcon; fly back toward the Emperor’s whisde!  O lovers, lovers, the time of union and encounter has come.The proclamation from heaven has come: “Moon-laced beau-ties, welcome hither!”Joyous hearts, joyous hearts, joy has come skirt a-trailing; wehave seized its chain, it has seized our skirts.The fiery potion has come; demon sorrow, sit in a corner;death-anxious soul, depart; immortal saki, enter in!The seven spheres of heaven are drunk with passion for you;we are as counters in your hand; our being through your beingis a myriad times at ease. Sweet- breathed minstrel, every instant shake the bell; Ogladness, saddle your steed; O zephyr, blow upon our souls!O sound of the sweet-conversing reed, in your note is thetaste of sugar; your note brings me night and morning the scentof fidelity.Make beginning again, play those airs once more; O sunlovely of presence, glory over all the lovely ones!Be silent, do not rend the veil; drain the flagon of the silentones; be a veiler, be a veiler, habituate yourself to the clemencyof God.How sweet it is to give speech and head, to converse withhis lip, especially when he opens the door and says, “Good sir,come in!”To the dry lip he tells the story of the fountain of Khidar;according to the stature of the man the tailor of his love cutsthe gown.The fountains become drunken through the intoxication ofhis eye; the trees are dancing before the gentle breeze of dawn.The nightingale says to the rosebush, “What is in your  heart? Declare it this instant. No other is near; only you and I.” The rosebush answers, “So long as you are with yourself,entertain not this ambition. Make a special effort to transportthe burden of your selfhood out of this earthly abode.”The eye of the needle of passion is narrow; know for a cer-tainty that it will not admit any thread when it perceives it to beof double strand.Behold how the sun is up to the throat in fire, so thatthrough its face the face of the earth may become full oflight.When Moses proceeded towards the burning bush, the bushsaid, “I am the water of Kauthar; take off your shoes, and come!Do not fear my fire, for I am water and sweet at that; youhave come to prosperity; the seat of honour is yours, welcome!io You are a pearl of pure lustre, a ruby of the mine, the soul ofplace and placelessness; you are the nonpareil of the age; whereare other creatures beside you?”Through love’s hand, every hand becomes the royal courtof munificence; through you, the faithless world becomes thefactory of fidelity.At the first hour of day you came, in your hand the royalbowl; you are drawing my soul towards the feast, saying,“Welcome!”What becomes of the heart, when the heart’s hand grasps thehand of a sweetheart? What becomes of the dross copper, whenit hears the welcoming voice of the philosopher’s stone?A wondrous darling came, in his hand a lance, like a bedouin.I said, “What service can I render?” He said, “Come up to me!” My heart leaped, saying, “Shall I run?” My reason said, “ShallI go?” Generously he signaled, saying, “Yes, both of you!”Since the table has come down from heaven, wash yourhands and your mouth too, that there may not proceed fromyour palms the odour of onions and chives.The mine of salt has arrived; take heed, if you are goodly anda lover. Seize the bowl, and give the cup; choose riot, not broth!Now I close these two lips, so that the lamp of day and nighteven with the flame of the tongue may tell you the whole story. + The king has come, the king has come; adorn the palace-hall;cut your forearms in honour of the fair one of Canaan.Since the Soul of the soul of the soul has come, it is not meetto mention the soul; in his presence of what use is the soul, saveas a sacrifice?Without love I was one who had lost the way; of a suddenlove entered. I was a mountain; I became a straw for the horseof the king.Whether he be Turk or Tajik, this slave is near to him even assoul to body; only the body does not behold the soul. Ho, my friends, good luck has arrived; the time has comefor offering up the load; a Solomon has come to the throne, todepose Satan.Leap from your place; why do you tarry? Why are you sohelpless? If you know it not, seek from the hoopoe the way toSolomon’s palace.There make your litanies, there utter your secrets and yourneeds; Solomon indeed knows the speech of all the birds.Speech is a wind, O slave, and distracts the heart; but hecommands it, “Gather together the scattered ones!”Have you ever seen any lover who was satiated with this pas-sion? Have you ever seen any fish that had become satiated withthis sea?Have you ever seen any image that was fleeing from theengraver? Have you ever seen any Vamiq asking pardon of‘Adhra?In separation, the lover is like a name empty of meaning; buta meaning such as belovedness has no need of names.  You are the sea, I am a fish — hold me as you desire; showcompassion, exercise kingly power — without you, I remainalone.Puissant emperor, what dearth of compassion is this then?The moment you are not present, the fire rages so high.If the fire beholds you, it withdraws to a corner; for whoeverplucks a rose from the fire, the fire bestows a lovely rose.Without you, the world is a torment; may it not be withoutyou for a single instant; by your life I implore this, for life with-out you is a torture and an agony to me .Your image like a sultan was parading within my heart, evenas a Solomon entering the Temple of Jerusalem;Thousands oflanterns sprang into flame, all the temple wasillumined; paradise and the Pool of Kauthar thronged withRid wan and houris.Exalted be God, exalted be God! Within heaven so manymoons! This tabernacle is full of houris, only they are hiddenfrom the eyes of the blind.Splendid, happy bird that has found a dwelling in love! Howshould any but the ‘Anqa find place and lodging in Mount Qaf?Splendid, lordly ‘Anqa, Emperor Shams-i Tabriz! For he isthe Sun neither of the east nor of the west, nor of any place.How would it be, if my fair love should take my hand tomor-row, hang his head through the window like the lovely-featuredmoon?If my life-augmenter enters, loosens my hands and feet? — Formy hands and feet too are bound fast by the hand of fixed ban-ishment.Then I would say to him, “By your life I swear that withoutyou, O life of my soul, gay company makes me not happy, nei-ther does wine intoxicate me.”  Then if he replies coquettishly, “Be gone! What do youwant of me? I fear that your melancholy may make memelancholic ! ” — I would bring sword and windingsheet and bow my neck as asacrificial offering, saying, “Your head is aching because of me;strike deliberately!You know that I desire not to live without you; better for meis death than banishment, by God who brings the dead to life.I never could believe that you would turn away from yourservant; I ever said, the words spoken by my enemies are lyinginventions.You are my soul, and without my soul I know not how tolive; you are my eyes, and without you I have not a seeing eye.”Let go these words; minstrel, strike up an air; bring forwardrebeck and tambourine, if you do not have a reed pipe.IOToday give in full measure that pure wine; strike in utterconfusion this hasty wheel of heaven.Even granted that the unseen bowl has come hidden fromthe eyes, it is not possible to conceal drunkenness and depravity.Love, whose trade is joy, sweet of speech and sweet ofthought, snatch now the veil from the face of that veiled king;Auspicious one, that cries of exultation may arise from thisside and that, ho, fill up, rosy of cheek, flagon and bowl. If you do not wish the rosebower to be disclosed, why didyou open the rosewater shop?Having robbed us of our senses and set this river flowing,fling into the water with all speed the water-duckling.O soul, we are as corn sprung in this expanse, dry oflip andseeking with our lives the cloud-borne rain.On every side a new messenger declares, “You will neverfind; depart!” Cry “God forfend” against that ill-omened crow.  Riot -provoker of every spirit, purse-robber of every Goha,filching the rebeck from the hand of Bu Baler the Lutanist,Today I desire that you should intoxicate and craze this chat-terbox soul, that wordy reason.Water oflife to us, become manifest as the resurrection, whatthough the milk of the scabby camel is life to the bedouin.Very lovely is your majesty and beauty; be silent and holdyour breath, make not aware of us every heedless one drownedin slumber.IILike the rose I am laughing with all my body, not only withmy mouth, because I am without myself, alone with the king ofthe world.You who came with torch and at dawn ravished my heart,dispatch my soul after my heart, do not seize my heart alone .Do not in rage and envy make my soul a stranger to myheart; do not leave the former here, and do not summon thelatter alone.Send a royal message, issue a general invitation; how long, sultan, shall the one be with you and the other alone?If you do not come tonight as yesterday and close my lips, will make a hundred uproars, my soul, I will not lament alone.Come, you who have given new life to the world, put out ofaction cunning reason.Until you flight me like an arrow, I cannot fly; come, fillonce more the bow.Because of your love, the bowl has fallen again from the roof;once more send down from the roof that ladder. + Men ask me, “In which direction is His roof?” In that direc-tion whence the soul was brought; In that direction whither every night the soul departs, thenin the time of dawn He brings back the soul;In that direction whence spring comes to the earth, and atdawn He bestows a new lamp upon the heavens;In that direction whence a staff became a serpent, and Hebore off Pharaoh’s host to hell;In that direction whence arose this quest in you — itself atoken, it seeks a token.You are that man who is seated upon an ass, and keeps askingof the ass this and that.io Be silent; for out of jealous regard He desires not to bring alland sundry into the sea.Do you break our harp, exalted one; thousands of otherharps are here.Since we have fallen into the clutches of love, what matters itif we lose harp or reed pipe?If the whole world’s rebeck and harp should be consumed,many a hidden harp there is, my friend;The twanging and strumming mounts to the skies, even if itdoes not enter the ears of the deaf. If the whole world’s lamp and candle should flicker out,what cause for sorrow is that, since flint and steel still remain?Songs are spindrift on the face of the sea; no pearl comes onthe surface of the sea;Yet know that the grace of the spindrift derives from the pearl,the reflection of the reflection of whose gleam is upon us.Songs are all but a branch of the yearning for union; branchand root are never comparable .Close your lips, and open the window of the heart; by thatway be conversant with the spirits.  O soul and stay of every soul, who bestow wings and set thespirits in motion,With you, what fear have we of loss, you who convert alllosses to gain?Alas tor the arrows of the glances and the brows curved likebows!You have sugared the ruby lips of fair idols, you have openedthose mouths in desire.You who have put a key in our hand and therewith openedthe door of the worlds,If you be not in the midst of us, then why are those waistsclose -girdled?And if yours is not the wine without token, of what are thesetokens testimony?And if you are beyond our surmise, yet through whom arethese surmises living?And if you are hidden from our world, from whom do thehidden things become manifest?Let go the tales of this world; we have grown aweary of them.The soul that has fallen into the sugar-sprinkler — howshould such things be contained in its heart?He who has become the earth tor your feet, how should hebe mindful of the heavens?Bind up our tongue with your protection; cast us not forthinto the midst of these tongues.I beheld the lovely rosebower face, that eye and lamp of allbrightness,That altar betore which the soul prostrates, that gladness andplace of security.  The heart said, “I will yield up my soul there, I will let go ofbeing and selfhood.”The soul also joined in the concert and began to clap hands. Reason came and said, “What shall I say regarding this goodfortune and sublime felicity,This scent of a rose that made upright as a cypress every backthat was curved and bent double?”In love all things are transformed; Armenian is changed toTurk.Soul, you have attained to the Soul of the soul; body, youhave abandoned bodihood.The ruby is the alms of our Beloved; the dervish eats thegold of the Rich;io That Mary in anguish discovers anew dates fresh and ripe.Lest the eye of a stranger should fall upon it, do not show offyour good deed to men;If your desire from faith is security, seek your security inseclusion.What is the place of seclusion? The house of the heart; be-come habituated to dwell in the heart;In the heart’s house is delivered that bowl of wholesome andeverlasting wine. Be silent, and practise the art of silence; let go all artful brag-ging;For the heart is the place of faith, there in the heart hold fastto faithfulness.Love has rose bowers amid the veil of blood; lovers have af-fairs to transact with the beauty of incomparable Love.Reason says, “The six directions are the boundary, and thereis no way out”; Love says, “There is a way, and I have manytimes travelled it.”  Reason beheld a bazaar, and began trading; Love has beheldmany bazaars beyond Reason’s bazaar.Many a hidden Mansur there is who, confiding in the soul ofLove, abandoned the pulpit and mounted the scaffold. Dreg-sucking lovers possess ecstatic perceptions inwardly;men of reason, dark of heart, entertain denials within them.Reason says, “Set not your foot down, for in the courtyardthere is naught but thorns”; Love says, “These thorns belong tothe reason which is within you.”Beware, be silent; pluck the thorn of being out of the heart’sfoot, that you may behold the rosebowers within you.Shams-i TabrizI, you are the sun within the cloud of words;when your sun arose, all speech was obliterated.Yesterday I gave a star a message for you; I said to it, “De-liver my compliments to that one fair as the moon.”Prostrating myself, I said, “Convey this prostration to thatsun who by his burning glow converts hard rocks to gold.”I opened my breast and showed it the wounds; I said to it,“Bear tidings of me to the Beloved who delights in drinkingblood.”I rocked to and fro to hush the infant of my heart; the infantsleeps when the cradle is rocked. Give milk to the infant of my heart, deliver us from turningabout, you who every moment succour a hundred helpless oneslike me.After all, in the first place the heart’s abode was the city ofunion; how long will you keep in exile this vagrant heart?I have relapsed into silence; but to ward off crop-sicknessturn about, O saki of the lovers, your vintner eye!  iGo forth, my comrades, draw along our beloved, at lastbring to me the fugitive idol;With sweet melodies and golden pretexts draw to the housethat moon sweet of presence.And if he promises, “I will come in another moment,” all hispromises are but cunning to beguile you.He possesses a flaming breath, by enchantment and wizardryknotting the water and tying up the air. When in blessedness and joy my darling enters, sit you downand behold the marvels of God!When his beauty shines forth, what shall be the beauty of thecomely ones? For his sun-bright face extinguishes all lamps.Go, fleet-paced heart, to Yemen, to my heart’s beloved, con-vey my greetings and service to that ruby beyond price .A garden — may its roses bloom till resurrection-day; anidol — may the two worlds be scattered over its beauty!At daybreak the prince of the fair ones stalks forth to thechase — may our hearts be the quarry for the arrows of hisglances!What messages are momently flashing from his eyes to mine —may my eyes be gladdened and intoxicated by his message!I broke down the door of an ascetic; with an imprecation hebanned me: “Be gone! May your days all be without peace!” Thanks to his curse, the beloved has left me neither peacenor heart, that beloved who thirsts for my blood — may Godbefriend him!My body is like the moon, melting away out oflove; myheart is like Venus’ harp — may its strings be snapped!Regard not the moon’s melting, Venus’ broken estate;  behold rather the sweetness of his sorrow — may it increase athousand-told!What a bride is in the soul! Through the reflection of herface may the world be fresh and figured as the hands of thenewly-wedded!Regard not the fleshly cheek, which corrupts and decays;regard the spiritual cheek — may it be fair and lovely for ever!The dark body is like a raven, and the physical world is win-ter — despite these two unlovelies, may there be spring eternal!For these two unlovelies subsist through the four elements;may your servants subsist through other than these four!When you display that rosy cheek, you set the stones a-spinning for joy.Once again put forth your head from the veil, for the sake ofthe dumbstruck lovers,That learning may lose the way, that the man of reason maybreak his science to pieces;That water through your reflection may convert to a pearl,that fire may abandon warfare.With your beauty, I desire not the moon, neither those twoor three hanging little lanterns.With your face, I do not call the ancient, rusty heavens a mirror.You breathed, and created anew in another shape this narrowworld.In desire for his Mars-like eye, play, Venus, again that harp!The heart is like a grain of corn, we are like a mill; how doesthe mill know why this turning?The body is like a stone, and the water its thoughts; the  stone says, “The water knows what is toward.”The water says, “Ask the miller, for it was he who flung thiswater down.”The miller says to you, “Bread-eater, if this does not turn,how shall the crumb-broth be?” Much business is in the making; silence, ask God, that Hemay tell you.Here someone is hidden; suppose not that you are alone. Shehas very sharp ears; do not open your tongue to evil.That peri has taken lodging by the fountain of your heart;thereby every form of image has become manifest to you.Wherever a fountain is, there is a place for peris; you must actcautiously there.Since these five fountains of the senses are flowing over yourbody, know that it is by the superintendence of that fairy thatsometimes they are stopped up, sometimes set flowing. Know also that those five inward senses, such as imaginationand conception, are likewise five fountains running towards thepasture.Every fountain has two superintendents and fifty controllers;they disclose their forms to you in the time of burnishing.The peris smite you if you are unmannerly, for this kind offamous peri is impetuous and shows no favour.Determinism beguiles deliberation, saying, “Now leap intoaction”; its cunning has snatched the blanket from a hundredthousand such as we.Behold the birds in the cage, behold the fishes in the net,behold the hearts lamenting on account of that knowingtrickster.io Open not your eye surreptitiously on any idol out of treach-ery, lest that all-seeing prince cast you from his regard.  Several verses still remain, but this fountain has sunk into theground; that will bubble up from the fountain when we leap uptomorrow.Bring into motion your amber-scattering tress; bring intodancing the souls of the Sufis.Sun, moon and stars dancing around the circle, we dancingin the midst — set that midst a-dancing.Your grace minstrelwise with the smallest melody brings intothe wheel the Sufi of heaven.The breeze of spring comes hurrying, uttering a melody; itsets the world a-laughing, raises autumn from the dead.Many a snake becomes a friend, rose partners thorn; theseason of scattering largesse is come to the king of the or-chard.Every moment a perfume wafts from the garden like a mes-sage some whither, as if to say, “Cry welcome today to thefriends!”The orchard, departed into its secret heart, is speaking toyou; do you depart into your own secret, that life may come toyour soul,That the lily’s bud may open its secret to the cypress, that thetulip may bring good tidings to willow and judas-tree,That the secret of every young shoot may emerge from thedepths, the ascensionists having set up a ladder in the garden.The songbirds and nightingales are seated in the branches,like the guardian enjoying his stipend from the treasury;These leaves are like tongues, these fruits like hearts — whenthe hearts show their feces, they give worth to the tongue.  You who are my soul’s repose in the time of pain, you whoare my spirit’s treasure in the bitterness of poverty,That which imagination never conceived, reason and un-derstanding never perceived, has entered my soul from you;therefore to you alone I turn in worship.Through your grace I gaze boldly upon eternal life; O king,how should a perishing empire beguile me?The melody of that person who brings me glad tidings ofyou, even if it be in sleep, is better than all poets’ songs to me. In the genuflections of prayer your image, O king, is as nec-essary and obligatory to me as the seven oft-repeated verses.When unbelievers sin, you are all compassion and interces-sion; to me you are the chief and leader of the stonyhearted.If everlasting bounty should offer all kingdoms and placebefore me every hidden treasure,I would prostrate myself with all my soul and lay my face onthe earth, I would say, “Out of all these, the love of a certainone for me ! ”For me the time of union is eternal life, for in that momentno time contains me.io Life is a vessel, and in it union is a pure wine; without you,of what avail to me is the labour of the vessels?Before this, twenty thousand desires were mine; in my pas-sion for him, not one single aspiration has remained to me.Through the succour of his grace, I have become securefrom the Monarch of the Unseen saying to me, Thou shalt notsee me.The essence of the meaning of “He” my heart and soul hasfilled; he is — even though he said he is not — the third and thesecond to me.Union with him transported my spirit; my body paid notattention, though disengaged from the body he became visibleto me.  I have become old in grief tor him; but when you nameTabriz, all my youth returns.Again the violet bent double has arrived beside the lily, againthe ruby-clad rose is tearing her gown to shreds;Again our green-gowned ones have gaily arrived from be-yond the world swift as the wind, drunken and stalking andjoyous.The standard-bearing cypress went off and consumed au-tumn with rage, and from the mountaintop the sweet-featuredanemone showed its face.The hyacinth said to the jasmine, “Peace be upon you”;the latter replied, “Upon you be peace; come, lad, into themeadow!” A Sufi on every side, having attained some favour, clappinghands like the plane-tree, dancing like the zephyr;The bud, concealing its face like veiled ladies — the breezedraws aside its chaddur saying, “Unveil your face, good friend!”The friend is in this quarter of ours, water in this our stream;lotus in your finery, why are you athirst and pale?Sour-faced winter has departed, that joy-slayer has beenslain; swift-footed jasmine, long may you live!The busy narcissus winked at the verdure; the verdure under-stood its words and said, “Yours is the command.” The clove said to the willow, “I am in hope of you”; thewillow answered, “My bachelor apartment is your privatechamber — welcome ! ”The apple said, “Orange, why are you puckered?” The or-ange replied, “I do not show myself off for fear of the evil eye.”The ringdove came cooing, “Where is that friend?” Thesweet-noted nightingale pointed him to the rose.Beside the world’s springtide there is a secret spring; moon-cheeked and sweet of mouth, give wine, O saki!  Moon rising in the shadows of darkness, the light of whoselamp vanquishes the sun at noon! Several words yet remain unsaid, but it is unseasonably late;whatever was omitted in the night I will complete tomorrow.If you are Love’s lover and in quest of Love, take a sharpdagger and cut the throat of bashfulness.Know that reputation is a great barrier in the path; what I sayis disinterested — accept it with a tranquil mind.Why did that madman work a thousand kinds of madness,that chosen wild one invent a thousand wiles?Now he rent his robe, now he ran over the mountains, nowhe quaffed poison, now he elected annihilation; Since the spider seized such huge prey, consider what preythe snare of My Lord the Most High will take!Since the love of Laila’s face had all that worth, how will it bewith He carried His servant by night?Have you not seen the Divans of Visa and Ramin? Have younot read the stories of Vamiq and ‘Adhra?You gather up your garment lest the water should wet it; youmust dive a thousand times into the sea.Love’s path has proved all drunkenness and abasement, torthe torrent flows downwards; how should it run upwards? You will be as a bezel in the lovers’ ring, if you are the ear-ringed slave of the king, my master;Just as this earth is thrall to the sky, just as the body is thrallto the spirit.Come, say, what loss did earth suffer from this bond? Whatkindnesses has not reason done to the members?My son, it behoves not to beat the drum under a blanket;plant your flag like a brave warrior in the midst of the plain.With your spirit’s ear listen to the thousand tumults echoingin the green dome’s air from the clamour of the passionate ones!  When the cords of your robe are loosened by Love’s intox-ication, behold then the angel’s rapture, the houri’s amaze-ment!How all the world trembles, on high and below, because ofLove, which transcends all below and on high!When the sun has arisen, where then remains night? Whenthe army of grace has come, where then remains affliction?I fell silent; Soul of the soul, do you speak, for every atomhas grown articulate out of love for your face.You have seized me by the ear — whither are you drawingme? Declare what is in your heart, and what your purpose is.Prince, what cauldron did you cook for me last night? Godknows what melancholy madness there is in Love!Since the ears of heaven and earth and the stars are all in yourhand, whither are they going? Even to that place whither yousaid, “Come!”The rest you seized only by one ear, me you seized by two;from the roots of each ear I say, “Long may you endure!”When a slave grows old, his master sets him free; when I be-came old, He enslaved me over again.Shall not children rise up white of hair at the resurrection?But your resurrection has turned the old men’s hair black.Since you bring the dead to life and make the old menyoung, I have fallen silent, and occupy myself with prayer.If you do not know Love, question the nights, ask of the palecheek and the dryness of the lips.Just as the water relates about the stars and the moon, evenso the physical forms relate about intellect and spirit.  From Love the soul learns a thousand manners of culture,such culture as cannot be found from schools.Amongst a hundred persons, the lover stands out as plain asthe shining moon in heaven amid the stars. The mind, though it be apprised of all the doctrines of thesects, knows nothing and is bewildered by the doctrine ofLove.The man who has a heart like Khidar, who has quaffed thewater of life of Love — to such a one the most limpid fountainsare nothing worth.Toil not in the garden; behold within the soul of the loverDamascus and Ghuta, rosebowers and all Nairab.What is Damascus? For that is a paradise full of angels andhouris; minds are amazed at those cheeks and rounded chins.Its delectable wine does not produce vomiting and crop-sickness, the sweetness of its halva does not give rise to boilsand fevers.io All men, from king to beggar, are in the tug of appetite;Love delivers the soul out of all appetites and desires.What pride does Love take in its purchasers? What sort of aprop are foxes to the lion?Upon the datepalm of the world I do not discover one ripedate, for all my teeth have been blunted by unripe dates.Fly on the wings of Love in the air and to the skies, be ex-empt like the sun from the need of all riding-beasts.Lovers’ hearts do not experience loneliness like simples, theyhave no fear of severance and separation like compounds. Providence chose Love for the sake of the souls, the Causepurchased Love out of all things caused.Love’s deputy entered the breast of the Cadi of Kab, so thathis heart should shy from giving judgment and such prattle.What a world! What rare arrangement and ordering, thatcasts a thousand confusions into well-ordered things!Beggar of Love, for all the joys that the world contains,reckon that Love is the gold-mine, and those things but gilded.  Love, you have filched my heart by trickery and cunning; youlied — God forfend! — but sweetly and charmingly.I desire to mention you, Love, with gratitude; but I am dis-traught with you, and my thought and reason are confused.Were I to praise Love in a hundred thousand languages,Love’s beauty far surpasses all such stammerings.Our desert has no bounds, our hearts and souls know no rest.World upon world took shape and form; which of theseshapes is ours?When you see on the road a severed head which goes rollingtowards our arena,Ask of it, ask of it our secrets, for from it you will hear ourhidden mystery.How would it be, if but one ear showed itself, familiar withthe tongues of our birds?How would it be if one bird took wing, having on its neckthe collar of our Solomon’s secret?What am I to say, what suppose? For this tale transcends ourbounds and possibilities.Yet how shall I keep silence? For every moment this distrac-tion of ours becomes yet more distraught.What partridges and falcons are flying with wings outspreadamidst the air of our mountainland,Amidst the air, which is the seventh atmosphere, on the sum-mit whereof is our portico!Leave this tale; ask not of us, for our tale is broken entirely;Salah al-Haqq wa ’-DIn will display to you the beauty of ourEmperor and Ruler. l A hundred drums are being beaten within our hearts, theroar of which we shall hear tomorrow.Cotton wool in the ear, hair in the eye — that is the anxietytor tomorrow, the subtle whisper of grief;Fling Love’s flame into this cotton wool, like Hallaj and likethe people of purity.Why do you keep fire and cotton wool together? These twoare opposites, and the opposite never survived. Since the encounter of Love is near, be joyous of presencefor the day of meeting.For us, death is gladness and encounter; if for you it is anoccasion of mourning, depart hence!Inasmuch as this present world is our prison, the ruining ofprisons is surely a cause for joy.Fie whose prison was so delightful — how shall be the courtof Him who adorned the world?Look not for constancy in this prison, for herein constancyitself never kept faith.Hark, for I am at the door! Open the door; to bar the door isnot the sign of good pleasure.In the heart of every atom is a courtyard for You; until Youunbar it, it will remain in concealment.You are the Splitter of Dawn, the Lord of the Daybreak; Youopen a hundred doors and say, “Come in!”It is not I at the door, but You; grant access, open the doorto Yourself. Sulphur came to a fire; it said, “Come out to me, beloved!My form is not your form, but I am all you, my form is asa veil.  I become you in form and reality when you arrive, my form isblotted out in the encounter.”The fire replied, “I have come forth; why should I veil myface from my very self?”Hark, receive from me and deliver my message to all thecompanions and all the kinsmen,io If it is a mountain, draw it like a straw; I have given you thequality of amber.My amber draws the mountain; did I not bring forth MountHira out of nonexistence?I am wholly and completely within your heart; {come towardyour own heart — Welcome!I am the heart-stealer and I take the heart,} for the pearl ofthe heart was born of my ocean.I move my shadow, otherwise how is it that my shadow isapart from me? But I transport it from its place so that, at the time of unveil-ing, its union may become manifest,So that it may realize that it is a branch of me, so that it maybecome separated from all other.Go to the saki and hear the rest of it, that he may tell you itwith the tongue of immortality.The wheel of heaven, with all its pomp and splendour, circlesaround God like a mill.My soul, circumambulate around such a Kaaba; beggar, cir-cle about such a table.Travel like a ball around in His polo-field, inasmuch as youhave become happy and helpless.Your knight and rook are circumambulating about the king,even though you move from place to place on this chessboard. He set on your finger the royal signet so that you might be-come a ruler having authority.  Whoever circumambulates about the heart becomes the soulof the world, heart-ravishing.The heart-forlorn becomes companion to the moth, he cir-cles about the tip of the candle,Because his body is earthy and his heart of fire — congenerhas an inclination towards congener.Every star circles about the sky, because purity is the con-gener of purity.io The mystic’s soul circles about annihilation, even as ironabout a magnet,Because annihilation is true existence in his sight, his eyeshaving been washed clean of squinting and error;The drunkard made ablution in urine, saying, “O Lord, de-liver me out of impurity.”God answered, “First realize what impurity is; it is not meetto pray crookedly and topsy-turvy.For prayer is a key; and when the key is crooked, you will notattain the favour of opening the lock.” I fall silent; all of you, leap up! The cypress-like stature of myidol cries come!Emperor of Tabriz, my King, Shams-i Din, I have closed mylips; do you come, and open!The water has been cut off from this world’s river; O spring-tide, return and bring back the water! —Of that water whose like the fountain of Khidar and Ilyasnever saw and will never see.Glorious fountain, through the splendour of whose gushingevery moment water bubbles up from the well of the soul.When waters exist, loaves grow; but never, my soul, did wa-ter grow from loaf. O guest, do not beggarlike shed the water from the face ofpoverty for the sake of a morsel of bread.  The entire world from end to end is but half a morsel; be-cause of greed tor half a morsel, the water vanished.Earth and heaven are bucket and pitcher; water is outsideearth and heaven.Do you also speed forth from heaven and earth, that youmay behold water flowing from placelessness,That the fish of your soul may escape from this pool, and sipwater from the boundless sea.io In that sea whose fishes are all Khidars, therein the fish isimmortal, immortal the water.From that vision came the light of the eye, from that roof isthe water in the spout;From that garden are these roses of the cheeks, from thatwaterwheel the rosebower obtains water;From that date-tree are the dates of Mary. That water derivesnot from secondary causes and suchlike things.Your soul and spirit will then become truly happy, when thewater comes flowing towards you from hence. Shake no more your rattle like a nightwatchman, for thewater itself is the guardian of these fishes.Do you not know what the rebeck says concerning tears ofthe eyes and burning hearts?“I am a skin far sundered from the flesh; how should I notlament in separation and torment?”The stick also says, “I was once a green branch; that caval-cade broke and tore to pieces my saddle.”We are exiles in separation; O kings, give ear to us — “ToGod is the returning.” From God in the first place we sprang in the world; to Himlikewise we revert from the revolution.Our cry is like the bell in the caravan, or as thunder when theclouds travel the sky.  Wayfarer, set not your heart upon a lodging-place, becomingweary at the time of attraction;For you have departed from many a stage, from the spermuntil the season of youth.Take it lightly, that you may escape easily; give up readily,and so find the reward.io Take hold of Him firmly, tor He has taken firm hold on you;first He and last He — go, discover Him.Gendy He draws the bow, tor that arrow of His quivers inthe hearts of the lovers.Be the lover Turk or Greek or Arab, this cry right enough isfellow-tongue with him.The wind is lamenting and calling to you, “Come in mywake, even to the river of water.I was water; I became wind; I have come to deliver thethirsty ones from this mirage.” Speech is that wind which was formerly water; it becomeswater when it casts off the veil.This shout arose from without the six directions: “Flee fromdirection, and turn not your face from Us.”O lover, you are not less than the moth; when does the mothever avoid the flame?The King is in the city; for the sake of the owl how should Iabandon the city and occupy the ruin?If an ass has gone mad, strike the ox-whip upon its head untilits senses return. If I seek his heart, his worthlessness increases still more; Godsaid regarding the unbelievers, Strike their necks.That moon has returned, whose like the sky never saw evenin dreams; he has brought a fire which no water can extinguishBehold the body’s tenement, and behold my soul — Love’scup has intoxicated the one and ruined the other.  When the master of the tavern became my heart’s compan-ion, my blood turned to wine out of love, my heart to roast.When the eye is filled with his image, a voice proclaims,“Well done, goblet, and bravo, wine!” My heart suddenly descried the ocean of Love; it leaped awayfrom me, saying, “Come, find me now!”The sun of the countenance of Shams-i Din, Pride ofTabriz — in its track like clouds all hearts are running.You who possess not Love, it is lawful to you — sleep on; begone, for Love and Love’s sorrow is our portion — sleep on.We have become motes of the sun of sorrow for the Beloved;you in whose heart this passion has never arisen, sleep on.In endless quest of union with Him we hurry like a river; youwho are not anguished by the question “Where is He?” — sleepon.Love’s path is outside the two and seventy sects; since yourlove and way is mere trickery and hypocrisy, sleep on. His dawn-cup is our sunrise, his crepuscule our supper; youwhose yearning is tor viands and whose passion is for supper,sleep on.In quest of the philosopher’s stone we are melting like cop-per; you whose philosopher’s stone is the bolster and the bed-fellow, sleep on.Like a drunkard you are falling and rising on every side, tornight is past and now is the time tor prayer; sleep on.Since fate has barred slumber to me, young man, be gone;for sleep has passed you by and you can now fulfil slumber;sleep on.We have fallen into Love’s hand — what will Love do? Sinceyou are in your own hand, depart to the right hand — sleep on.io I am the one who drinks blood; my soul, you are the one whoeats viands; since viands for a certainty demand slumber, sleep on.  I have abandoned hope for my brain and my head too; youaspire to a fresh and juicy brain — sleep on.I have rent the garment of speech and let words go; you,who are not naked, possess a robe — sleep on.Since midnight sickness has manifested itself in that Mas-ter; till daybreak he has been beating his head uncontrollablyagainst our wall.Heaven and earth weep and lament because of his lamen-tation; his breaths have become fiery — you might say he is afire-temple.He has a strange sickness — no headache, no feverishpain — no remedy is to be found for it on earth, for it came uponhim out of heaven.When Galen beheld him he took his pulse; and he said,“Let go my hand and examine my heart; my pain is beyond therules.”He suffers neither from yellow nor black bile, neither colicnor dropsy; a hundred tumults have arisen in every corner ofour city because of this untoward happening.He neither eats nor sleeps; he receives his nourishmentfrom Love, for this Love is now both nurse and mother to theMaster.I said, “O God, grant compassion, that he may find rest fora brief hour; he has spilled no man’s blood, he has seized noman’s property.”The answer came from heaven, “Let him be as he is, formedicine and remedy are useless in lovers’ suffering.Seek no cure for this Master; do not bind him, do not counselhim, for where he has fallen is neither transgression nor piety.When did you ever see Love? You have never heard fromlovers; keep silent, chant no spells; this is not a case for magic orjugglery!”  Come, Shams-i Tabriz!, source of light and radiance, torthis illustrious spirit without your splendour is frozen andcongealed.I have come so that, tugging your ear, I may draw you tome, unheart and unself you, plant you in my heart and soul.Rosebush, I have come a sweet springtide unto you, to seizeyou very gently in my embrace and squeeze you.I have come to adorn you in this worldly abode, to conveyyou above the skies like lovers’ prayers.I have come because you stole a kiss from an idol fair; give itback with a glad heart, master, for I will seize you back.What is a mere rose? You are the All, you are the speaker ofthe command Say. If no one else knows you, since you are I, Iknow you.You are my soul and spirit, you are my Fatiha- chanter; be-come altogether the Fatiha, so that I may chant you in myheart.You are my quarry and game, though you have sprung fromthe snare; return back to the snare, and if you go not, I willdrive you.The lion said to me, “You are a wondrous deer; be gone!Why do you run in my wake so swiftly? I will tear you to pieces.”Accept my blow, and advance forward like a hero’s shield;give your ear to naught but the bowstring, that I may bend youlike a bow.So many thousand stages there are from earth’s bounds toman; I have brought you from city to city, I will not leave youby the roadside.Say nothing, froth not, do not raise the lid of the cauldron;simmer well, and be patient, tor I am cooking you.No, tor you are a lion’s whelp hidden in a deer’s body: I willcause you suddenly to transcend the deer’s veil.  You are my ball, and you run in the curved mallet of my de-cree; though I am making you to run, I am still running in yourtrack.Come, come, tor the rosebower has blossomed; come, come,tor the beloved has arrived.Bring at once altogether soul and world; deliver over to thesun, for the sun has drawn a fine blade.Laugh at that ugly one showing off airs; weep for that friendwho is severed from the Friend.The whole city seethed when the rumour ran abroad that themadman had once again escaped from his chains. What day is it, what day is it, such a day of uprising? —Perchance the scroll of men’s deeds has already fluttered fromthe skies.Beat the drums, and speak no more; what place is there forheart and mind? For the soul too has fled.This house wherein continually rings the sound of the bell-staff — ask of the master what house this house is.What is this idol -form, if it is the house of the Kaaba? Andwhat is this light of God, if it is the Magian temple?In this house is a treasure which the whole of being cannotcontain; this house and this master are all a fiction and a pretence.Lay not hand upon this house, for this house is a talisman;speak not to the master, for he is drunk since last night. The dust and rubbish of this house is all ambergris and musk;the noise of the door of this house is all verse and melody.In short, whoever enters this house has found a way to theKing of the world, the Solomon of the time.  Master, bend down your head once from this roof, for inyour fair face is the token of fortune.I swear by your life that, but for beholding your counte-nance, though it be the kingdom of the earth, all is mere fantasyand fable.The garden is baffled as to which is the leaf, which the blos-som; the birds are distraught as to which is the snare, which thebait.This is the Master of heaven, who is like unto Venus and themoon, and this is the house of Love, which is without boundand end.The soul, like a mirror, has received your image in its heart;the heart has sunk like a comb into the tip of your tress.Since in Joseph’s presence the women cut their hands, cometo me, my soul, for the Soul is there in the midst.The whole household is drunk, and nobody is aware whoenters the threshold, whether it be X or Y.It is inauspicious; do not sit on the threshold, enter thehouse at once; he whose place is the threshold keeps all indarkness.Though God’s drunkards are thousands, yet they are one;the drunkards of lust are all double and treble.Enter the lions’ thicket and do not be anxious for thewounding, for the anxiety of fear is the figments of women;For there no wounding is, there all is mercy and love, butyour imagination is like a bolt behind the door.Set not fire to the thicket, and keep silence, my heart; drawin your tongue, for your tongue is a flame.Come, for today is for us a day of festival; henceforward joyand pleasure are on the increase.Clap hands, say, “Today is all happiness”; from the begin-ning it was manifestly a fine day.  Who is there in this world like our Friend? Who has seensuch a festival in a hundred cycles?Earth and heaven are filled with sugar; in every directionsugarcane has sprouted.The roar of that pearl-scattering sea has arrived; the world isfull of waves, and the sea is invisible.Muhammad has returned from the Ascension; Jesus has ar-rived from the fourth heaven.Every coin which is not of this place is counterfeit; everywine which is not of the cup of the Soul is impure.What a splendid assembly, where the saki is good fortune,and his companions are Junaid and Ba Yazld!Crop-sickness afflicted me when I was desirous; I did notknow that God Elimself desires us.Now I have fallen asleep and stretched out my feet, since Ihave realised that good fortune has drawn me on.In this river the heart is like a ruined waterwheel; in which-ever direction it turns, there is water before it;And even if you turn your back to the water, the water runshurrying before you.Flow shall the shadow save its soul from the sun, seeing thatits soul is in the hand of the sun?If the shadow stretches forth its neck, the sun’s face that in-stant is shrouded.Brave Sun, before which this sun in heaven quivers with fearlike quicksilver!The moon is like quicksilver on a palsied palm — one nightonly, and for the rest it is poured forth;In every thirty nights, two nights it is united and lean, for therest it endures separation, and separation is torture.Though it is wretched, it is fresh of face; laughter is the habitand wont oflovers.  It lives laughing, and likewise dies laughing, for its return isto laughing fortune.Keep silent, for the faults of vision always come from ques-tion and answer.So long as the form of the Beloved’s image is with us, for usthe whole of life is a joyful parade.Where friends unite together, there in the midst of thehouse, by Allah, is a spreading plain;And where the heart’s desire comes true, there one thorn isbetter than a thousand dates.When we are sleeping at the head of the Beloved’s lane, ourpillow and blankets are the Pleiades;When we are twisted into the tip of the Beloved’s tress onthe Night of Power, power belongs to us.When the reflexion of His beauty shines forth, mountainlandand earth are silk and brocade.When we ask of the breeze the scent of Him, in the breeze isthe echo of lute and reedpipe.When we write His name in the dust, every particle of dust isa dark-eyed houri.We chant a spell of Him over the fire; thereby the raging firebecomes water-cool.Why shall I tell a long tale? For when we mention His nameto nonbeing too, it increases being.That subtlety in which Love is contained is fuller of pith thana thousand walnuts.That instant when Love showed its face, all these things van-ished from the midst.Silence! For the sealing has been completed; the totality ofdesire is God Most High.  Today a new madness has arrived, it has dragged the chainsof a thousand hearts;Today it has rent the sides of the bags of white sugar candy.Again that bedouin has purchased the Joseph of beauty toreighteen base pieces.All night the souls in glory and felicity pastured amidst nar-cissus and jasmine,Until with the dawn of course every spirit leaped forth nim-ble and sprightly.Today narcissus-bed and anemone have blossomed out ofstones and clods,The tree has bloomed in the midst of winter, in January thefruits have ripened.You might say that God has created a new world in this an-cient world.Lover-gnostic, recite this ode, for Love has chosen you outof all the lovers.On your golden cheek there is a toothmarlc — has that silvery-breasted one perchance bitten you?It is right that He should cherish that heart which hasthrobbed much in anguish for Him.Silence! Go sauntering through the meadow for today it isthe turn for the eyes to behold.Which is the road by which I came? I would return, for itlikes me not here;One moment’s absence from the Beloved’s lane is unlawfulaccording to the doctrine of lovers.If only in all the village there is someone — by Allah, a signwould be completely sufficient.  How shall the finch escape? For even the simurgh is footfastin this stout snare. My heart, do not come wandering in this direction; sit there,for it is a pleasant station.Choose that dessert which augments life, seek that winewhich is full-bodied;The rest is all scent and image and colour, the rest is all warand shame and opprobrium;Be silent, and sit down, for you are drunk, and this is theedge of the roof.Be gathered together, comrades, for this is not the time tosleep; by Allah, every comrade who sleeps is not of the truecompanions.Whoever is not turning about and weeping after the fashionof a waterwheel shall not see the face of the garden, he will losethe way to the garden.You who have sought the heart’s desire in the world of waterand clay, you are running towards that river in which there is nowater.O moon, come forth from the heart’s sky and turn our nightto day, that no night-traveller may say, “Tonight is not a nightof moonshine.” May my heart be unapprised of where the Beloved is, if myheart is not quivering like the heart of quicksilver for the love ofHim.Love resides not in science and learning, scrolls and pages;whatever men chatter about, that way is not the lovers’ way.Know that the branch of Love is in pre-eternity and its roots  in post-eternity; this tree rests not upon heaven and earth, uponlegs.We have deposed reason and circumscribed passion, tor suchmajesty is not appropriate to this reason and these habits.So long as you are desirous, know that this desire of yours isan idol; when you have become beloved, after that there is noexistence tor the desirous. The mariner is always upon the planks of fear and hope;once planks and mariner have passed away, nothing remainsbut drowning.Shams-i Tabriz!, you are at once sea and pearl, tor your beingentirely is naught but the secret of the Creator.Mind you do not slip, tor the road behind and ahead is wetwith blood; man-robbers are nowadays more numerous thangold-robbers.If they are intent on robbing people of reason and awareness,what then will they make of him who is unaware of himself?Do not consider yourself’s self so worthless and withoutantagonist; the world is in quest of gold, and your self is themine of gold.The prophet of God said, “Men are as mines”; the self is amine of silver and gold and is truly full of gems. You find a treasure, and therein you find not life tor all thetreasure; discover yourself, for this worldly treasure passes awayfrom you.Discover yourself, and be wary; yet what are you to do? Forthere is a wakeful, quickhanded thief on this way.Though the dawn is dark, day is to be reckoned at hand;whoever’s lace is turned towards the sun is as the dawn.The spirits become intoxicated through the breath of day-break, inasmuch as the face of daybreak is towards the sun andis the companion of vision.  You fling down the counter so many times upon “haply” and“perchance,” for you are very bankrupt, and heaven’s wheelcarries off everything.io Brain-sieved and aware of nothing, you have fallen asleep —one might say your morsel of daily bread is the brain of an ass.Labour more, and collect gold, and be joyful, for all yoursilver and gold and wealth is the serpent of hell.For God’s sake, live one night without eating and sleeping; ahundred nights because of lust your carnal soul is sleepless andfoodless.Out of agony and grief, from behind every atom of dustcomes sighing and lamentation, but your ear is deaf.Sprinkle the heart’s blood on your cheek at dawn, for yourprovision for the way is heart’s blood and the sigh of morn. Fill your heart with hope, and polish it well and clear, foryour pure heart is the mirror of the sun of splendour.Say, who is the companion of Ahmad the Aposde in thisworld? Shams-i Tabriz the Emperor, who is one of the greatestthings.Lias perchance this instant the tip of that tress become scat-tered? For such a Tartar musk has become amber-diffusing.Lias perchance the dawn breeze lifted the veil from Flis face?For thousands of unseen moons have begun to shine.Is there any soul which is not happy through Flis sweetperfume? Though the soul has no clue as to the source of itshappiness.Many a happy rose is laughing through the breath of God,yet every soul does not know whence it has become laughing. Flow fairly the sun of Flis cheek has shone today, throughwhich thousands of hearts have become rubies of Badakhshan.Yet why should not the lover set his heart upon Himthrough whose grace the body has become wholly soul?  Did the heart perchance one morning behold Him as He is,so that from that vision of Him it has today become after thiswise?Ever since the heart beheld that peri-born beauty of mine, ithas taken the glass into its hand and become an exorcist.If His sweet breeze blows upon the tree of the body, howa-tremble two hundred leaves and two hundred branches havebecome!If there is not an immortal soul tor every one slain by Him,why has it become so easy for the lover to yield up his soul?Even the aware ones are unaware of His life and activities, forHis life and activities have become their veil.If the minstrel of Love has not breathed upon the reed of aheart, why has every tip of the hair become lamenting like thereed pipe?If Shams-i Tabriz does not fling clods from the roof againstthe heart, then why have the souls become as it were his door-keepers?He said, “Who is at the door?” I said, “Your humble slave.”He said, “What is your business?” I said, “Lord, to greet you.”He said, “How long will you drive?” I said, “Until you call.”He said, “How long will you boil?” I said, “Till the resurrection.”I laid claim to love, I swore many oaths that for love’s sake Ihad lost kingship and nobility.He said, “For a claim the cadi requires witness.” I said, “Mywitness is my tears, my sign the pallor of my cheeks.”He said, “Your witness is invalid; your eye is wet-skirted.” Isaid, “By the splendour of your justice, they are just and with-out fault.”He said, “Who was your companion?” I said, “Your fantasy,O King.” He said, “Who summoned you hither?” I said, “Thescent of your cup.”  He said, “What is your intention?” I said, “Fidelity andfriendship.” He said, “What do you desire of me?” I said, “Youruniversal grace.”He said, “Where is it most agreeable?” I said, “Caesar’spalace.” He said, “What did you see there?” I said, “A hundredmiracles.”He said, “Why is it desolate?” I said, “For fear of the high-wayman.” He said, “Who is the highwayman?” I said, “Thisblame.”He said, “Where is safety?” I said, “In abstinence and godli-ness.” He said, “What is abstinence?” I said, “The way of salva-tion.”He said, “Where is calamity?” I said, “In the street of yourlove.” He said, “How fare you there?” I said, “In perfect recti-tude.”Silence! For if I were to utter his subtleties you would comeforth from yourself, neither door nor roof would remain to you.Show your face, tor the orchard and rosegarden are my de-sire; open your lips, for abundant sugar is my desire.Sun of beauty, come forth one moment out of the cloud, forthat glittering, glowing countenance is my desire.Out of your air I heard the sound of the falcon-drum; I re-turned, for the sultan’s forearm is my desire.You said capriciously, “Trouble me no more; be gone!” Thatsaying of yours, “Trouble me no more,” is my desire,And your repulse, “Be gone, the king is not at home,” andthose mighty airs and brusqueness of the doorkeeper, are mydesire.In the hand of every one who exists there are filings ofbeauty; that quarry of elegance and that mine are my desire.This bread and water of heaven’s wheel are like a treacheroustorrent; I am a fish, a leviathan, Oman is my desire.  Like Jacob I am crying alas, alas; the fair visage of Joseph ofCanaan is my desire .By Allah, without you the city is a prison tor me; I wanderabroad, mountain and desert are my desire,io My heart is weary of these weak-spirited fellow-travellers; theLion of God and Rustam-i Dastan are my desire.My soul is sick of Pharaoh and his tyranny; that light of thecountenance of Moses son of ‘Imran is my desire.I am aweary of these tearful people so full of complaining;that ranting and roaring of the drunkards is my desire.I am more eloquent than the nightingale, but because ofvulgar envy a seal is on my tongue, and lamentation is mydesire.Last night the shaikh went all about the city, lamp in hand,crying, “I am weary of beast and devil, a man is my desire.” They said, “He is not to be found, we too have searched.”He answered, “He who is not to be found is my desire.”Though I am penniless, I will not accept a small carnelian,for that rare, precious carnelian is my desire.Hidden from every eye, and all things seen are from Him —that hidden One manifest in works is my desire.My state has gone beyond every desire and yearning; frommine and place to the elements is my desire.My ear heard the tale of faith and became drunk; where is theportion of sight? The form of faith is my desire. In one hand the winecup, in the other the Beloved’s curl — todance so in the midst of the arena is my desire.That rebeck says, “I am dead of expectation; the hand andbosom and plectrum of ‘Uthman are my desire.”I am at once Love’s rebeck, and Love is my rebeck-player;those favours of the plucking of the All-merciful are mydesire.Cunning minstrel, number the rest of this ode after this fash-ion, for it is after this fashion I desire.Show your face from the east, Sun of the Pride of Tabriz; Iam the hoopoe, the presence of Solomon is my desire.  Though from left and right there is useless criticism and vilifi-cation, that man who has lost his heart turns not away from Love.The moon scatters light, and the dog barks at it; what harmdoes that do to the moon? Such is a dog’s speciality.The lover is a mountain, not a straw to be blown away by thewind; it is a flock of flies that the wind has waylaid.If it is the rule that blame should arise from Love, it is alsothe rule for Love to be deaf to it. Desolation of both worlds on this road is true cultivation; toeschew all benefits is a benefit in Love.Jesus from the fourth sphere calls, “Welcome! Wash yourhands and mouth, for now is the time for the Table.”Go, become effaced in the Friend in the tavern of not-being;wherever two drunkards are together, there is bound to be abrawl.You enter the devil’s court crying, “Justice, justice!” Seekjustice from God, for here is nothing but wild beasts.The Prophet said, “Take not counsel from a woman”; thiscarnal soul of ours is a woman, even though it be an abstinent,io Drink so much wine that you cease to chatter; after all, areyou not a lover? And is not this love a tavern?Though you should utter verse and prose like Ja‘fari gold,there where Ja‘far is it is all worthless tales.My soul, spiritual beauty is passing fair and glorious, yet yourown beauty and loveliness is something beside.You who spend years describing spirit, show one quality thatis equal to his essence.Through his phantasm the light of the eye increases, yet forall that in the presence of union with him it is clouded. i I stand open-mouthed in reverence tor that beauty; everymoment “God is greater” is on my tongue and in my heart. The heart has acquired an eye constant in desire of you; ah,how that desire nourishes the heart and eye!Speak not of houris and moon, spirit and peri, for these re-semble Him not; He is something other.Slave-caressing it is that your love has practised, else where isthe heart that is worthy of that love?Every heart that has been sleepless for one night in desire foryou is bright as day, and the air by it is illumined.Every one who has become without object is as your disciple;his object is realized without the form of object.io Every limb of hell who has burned and fallen into this love,has fallen into Kauthar, for your love is Kauthar.My foot does not reach the ground out of hope for union,withal through separation from you my hand is on my head.My heart, be not sorrowful at this oppression of foes, andmeditate on this, that the Sweetheart is judge.If my enemy is glad because of my saffron-pale face, is notmy saffron-pale face derived from the red rose?Since my Beloved’s beauty surpasses description, how fat ismy grief, and how lean my praise! Yes, since it is the rule that the more the pain of the wretchedsufferer is, the less is his lament.Shams-i Din shone moonlike from Tabriz; no, what is themoon indeed? That face outshines the moon.That spirit which wears not true love as a garment is betternot to have been; its being is nothing but a disgrace.Be drunk in love, for love is all that exists; without the com-merce of love there is no admittance to the Beloved.They say, “What is love?” Say, “The abandonment of freewill.” He who has not escaped out of free will, no free will has he.  The lover is an emperor; the two worlds are scattered overhim; the king pays no heed to the scattering. Love it is and the lover that remain till all eternity; set notyour heart on aught but this, for it is merely borrowed.How long will you embrace a dead beloved? Embrace thesoul which naught embraces.What was born of spring dies in the season of autumn; love’srosebower receives no replenishment from spring.The rose that comes of spring, the thorn is its companion;the wine that comes of pressed grapes is not exempt from crop-sickness.Be not an expectant spectator on this path; for by Allah,there is no death worse than expectancy,io Set your heart on the true coin, if you are not counterfeit;give ear to this subtlety, if you lack an earring.Tremble not on the body’s steed; fare lighter afoot; Godgives wings to him who rides not on the body.Let go care and become wholly clear of heart, like the face ofa mirror without image and picture —When it has become clear of images, all images are containedin it; that clear-faced one is not ashamed of any man’s lace.Would you have your self clear of blemish? Gaze upon Him,for He is not ashamed or afraid of the truth. Since the steely face gained this skill from purity, what shallthe heart’s face, which is without dust, discover?I said, “What shall it discover?” No, I will not say; silenceis better, lest the heart-ravisher should say, “He cannot keep asecret.”Every moment the voice of Love is arriving from left and right;we are departing for the skies — who has a mind for sightseeing?We were once in heaven, we were friends of the angels; let usall return thither, for that is our city.  We are even higher than the heavens, we are greater thanangels; why should we not transcend both? Our lodging-placeis Majesty.How tar is the world of dust from the pure substance! Uponwhat have you alighted? Load up — what place is this?Young luck is our friend, to yield up the soul is our business;the leader of our caravan is Mustafa, Pride of the World.At his moon the moon was split, it could not endure to be-hold him; the moon attained such luck — she, a humble beggar.The sweet scent of the breeze is from the curl of his tress, theglitter of this phantasm is from that cheek like the forenoon.Behold in our hearts every moment a splitting of the moon,tor why does your eye soar beyond the vision of that vision?Mankind, like waterfowl, are sprung from the sea of thesoul; how should the bird that has risen from that sea make itsdwelling here?Nay rather, we are pearls in that sea, we are all present therein;else, why does wave upon wave surge from the sea of the heart?The wave of Alast came along and caulked the body’s ship;when the ship is wrecked once more, the turn of union andencounter will come.My being is but a goblet in the Beloved’s hand — look at myeyes, if you do not believe it.I am like a goblet, heart full of blood and body slender, inthe hand of Love, which is neither pale nor lean nor slender.This Love consumes nothing but Moslem blood; come, Iwill tell it in your ear — amazing, it is not an infidel.A thousand forms like Adam and Eve are born; the world isfull of His image, but He is not endowed with form.He knows what is salutary for the desert sand-grain and thedrop of the ocean, and brings replenishment, for His knowl-edge is not deaf.  Every moment He binds and releases our hearts; why shouldthe heart not know Him by His actions, if it is not an ass?Through being bound and released by the hand of the ass-driver the ass has become a gnostic, and knows that he is, andnone beside;Seeing him, it moves its head and ear assishly; it recogniseshis call, tor it is not disguised.From his hand it has consumed sweet provender and water —amazing! Do you not receive such provision from God?A thousand times He has fettered you in pain, and you havecried out; why do you disapprove? God is not constrained torelease you.Like the infidel you bow your head only in time of affliction;not worth half a grain is the head that belongs not yonder.A thousand spiritual forms are flying in the air like Ja‘far-iTaiyar, although they are not Ja‘far;But how should the cage-bird know about the air? It sup-poses gloomily, “I have no wings.”Every moment it puts its head out of the fissure of the cage;there is room for its head, but not its body, for the head is notthe whole .The fissure of your five senses is the fissure of that cage; yousee a thousand prospects, but there is no way to the prospect.Your body is dry tinder, and that vision is fire; when you lookwell into the matter, all is nothing but flame.Not tinder is it, for it has become fire in burning; know thatthe tinder is light, although it is not shining.For the sake of the ears of those who shall come after me Ispeak and set down; our life is not postponed;For Love has seized them by the ear and is bringing them bysecret ways where reason is no guide.Muhammad’s eye has closed in sleep, and the rebeck hasbecome feeble; sleep not — these words are a treasure of gold,even if they are not gold in truth.Mankind are stars, and Shams-i Tabriz! is the sun; which staris there that is not illumined by his sun?  What pearl are you? For in no man’s hand is the price of you.What does the world possess that is not your gift?Is there a worse punishment than his who lives exiled fromyour face? Do not punish your servant, tor all that he is unwor-thy of you.Every moment I would scatter my heart and soul in yourdust; dust be on the head of the soul that is not the dust of yourfeet!Blessed to all birds is your air; how unblest is the bird that isnot in your air! Amidst the billows of contingencies even the master shall notescape by swimming, if he is not familiar with you.The world has no permanence, and if it has, count it as per-ishing, since it is not intimate with your permanence.How happy is the king that is mated by your rook! How lairof presence is he who is never without your presence!I will not flee from your blow, for very raw indeed is theheart that is not roasted in the fire of your trial.The heart that has not been naughted turns its face to place;from placelessness you drive it, saying, “Begone! This is noplace for you.”io There is no end to your praise and praisers; what atom isthere that is not reeling with your praise?As Nizami expresses it in verse, “Tyrannise not, for I cannotendure your tyranny.”Three days it is now since my fair one has become changed;sugar is never bitter — how is it that that sugar is sour?I dipped my pitcher into the fountain that contained theWater of Life, and I saw that the fountain was full of blood.  In the garden where two hundred thousand roses grew,in place of fruit and blossom there are thorns and stones anddesert.I chant a spell and whisper it over the face of that peri — torincantation is always the business of the exorcist —Yet tor all my incantations my peri came not back into thebottle, since his activities transcend chants and spells.Between his brow there are ancient angers; the frown on thebrow of Laila is destruction to Majnun.Come, come, tor without you I have no life; see, see, torwithout you my eyes are a veritable flood.By the right of your moonlike countenance, brighten myeye, though my sins are greater than the whole of mankind’s.My heart turns about itself, saying, “What is my sin? For ev-ery cause is conjoined with a consequence.”A proclamation comes to me from the Marshal of eternaljudgment: “Seek not about your own self, for this cause be-longs not to now.”God gives and seizes, brings and carries away; His business isnot to be measured by reason’s scales.Come, come, for even now by the grace of Be and it A par-adise opens its gate which is ungrudging.Of the essence of the thorn you behold marvellous flowers;of the essence of the stone you see the treasure of Korah.Divine grace is eternal, and thereof a thousand keys lie hid-den between the kdf and the ship of the nun.Love is nothing but felicity and lovingkindness, it is nothingbut gladness and right guidance.Bu Hanifa did not teach love, Shaffi had no tradition con-cerning it.“Licit” and “illicit” operate till death; there is no terminus tothe science of lovers.  Lovers are drowned in sugar-water; Egypt has nothing tocomplain about sugar. How should the drunkard’s soul not utter thanks for a wineto which there is no boundary and limit?Whomsoever you have seen sorrowful and scowling is not alover, and belongs not to that province;Otherwise, every bud is a veil of a garden, jealousy and envyhave no contagion.The beginner in this path of Love is he who is not apprisedof beginning.Become naughted from selfhood, because there is no sinworse than being.io Do not be a shepherd, be a flock; shepherdry is nothing but abar to providential care.God is sufficient for many a servant’s ill, but the servant hasnot this knowledge and sufficiency.He says, “This is problematic and allegorical”; this is clear,this is not allegory.A blind man struck his foot against a pitcher; he said, “Thedoorkeeper is not careful.What are pitchers and glasses doing on the footpath? Theroad is not clear of these pots. Remove the pitchers from the path; the doorkeeper is notattending to his job.”The doorkeeper answered, “Blind man, no pitcher is on thepath, the fact is that you have no knowledge of the path.You have left the path and are going to the pitcher; that isplain error.”Master, your drunkenness in the way of religion is the onlysign from beginning to end.You are a sign, and a seeker after a sign; there is no bettersign than the seeker after a sign. You are astray from the path, otherwise in the path of striv-ing no striver goes without his wages.Just as an atom’s weight he shall see it, an atom’s weight ofslipping goes not unpunished;  An atom of good is not without a reward — open your eyes, ifyou are not blind.Every herb is a token of water; what is there that is not tribu-tary to that?Enough, this water has many tokens; the thirsty man requiresno counselling.oThe bird of my heart has again begun to flutter, the parrot ofmy soul has begun to chew sugar.My mad and drunken camel has begun to rend the chain ofreason.A gulp of that incautious wine has begun to flow over myhead and eyes.The lion of the gaze, despite the dog of the Companions ofthe Cave, has begun to drink my blood again.The water is flowing again in this river; by the riverbanlc thegrass has begun to shoot.The dawn breeze is blowing again in the garden, it has be-gun to blow over rose and rosebed.Love sold me for a single fault; Love’s heart burned, and hasbegun to buy back.He drove me away; compassion came to him and called;Love has begun to look kindly upon me.My enemy has seen that I am with the Friend; he has begunto gnaw his hand of envy.My heart has escaped from the trickery of fortune, it has be-gun to creep into Love’s bosom.The tale-bearer brow making hints has begun to curve overthat eye.When Love called my heart towards Him, my heart began toflee from all creation.Creatures are sticks; the blind man flings away the stick whenhe begins to see.  Creatures are like milk; the infant turns from milk when ithas begun to digest viands. The spirit is like a falcon taking wing, for it has begun to hearthe drum of the king.Enough, for the veil of speech has begun to spin a curtainaround you.lThe hour is late, the hour is late, the sun has gone down intothe well, the sun of the soul of lovers has entered the seclusionof God.A day is hidden in night, a Turk is amongst Hindus; night,launch your assaults, for that Turk is in the tent.If you catch a glimpse of this brightness, you will set sleepafire; for by night-faring and servitude Venus became the com-panion of the moon.We are fleeing by night and running apace, and the Zangisare on our track, for we carried off the gold, and the watchmanbecame aware. We have learned nightfaring and consumed a hundredwatchmen; our cheeks are lit up like candles because that pawnof ours has become king.Happy indeed is that smiling one who has pressed cheekagainst that cheek! Great and glorious is that heart which hasdeparted unto that Sweetheart!Who is there on the path of the heart who has not a sigh in hisheart? That man is truly successful who is drowned in that sigh.When he is drowned in the sea, the sea carries him up to thesurface, like Joseph of the well who emerged from the well togreatness.They say, “Man’s origin is the dust, and he returns to the dust.”How should he become dust who is the dust of this doorway? The crops appear all of one kind until the harvest-time ar-rives; one half of it has become fine grain, the other half is chaff.  Fair ones, fair ones, a fair one has gone mad; his bowl hasfallen from our roof, he has gone to the madhouse.He circled about the pool like men athirst seeking andsearching; suddenly like a dry crust he became a sop in ourpool.Learned man, stop up your ears against this; do not listento this incantation, for he has become a legend through ourcharm.The ears do not escape from this ring which has robbedminds of their reason; having laid his head on the millstone,he vanished like a grain into the measure. Regard it not as a sport, regard it not as a sport; here choosegambling away life; heads in plenty through love of his curlshave become turned upside down like a comb.Be not puffed up by your reason; many a well-trusted masterwho was a pillar of the world has become more lamenting thanthe Moaning Pillar.I, who have cut away from life, roselike have rent my robe,thence have become such that my reason has become a strangerto my soul.Those drops of individual reason have become vanquishedin the Sea of Reason; the atoms of these fragmentary souls havebecome annihilated in the Beloved.I will keep silent, I will perform the command and hidethis candle — a candle in whose light the sun and the moon aremoths.Who is that, who is that who makes the breast sorrowful,then when you make complaint before Him, He turns yourbitter sweet?  First He appears as a deaf adder, lastly He is a treasure ofpearls. Sweet King, who in a moment transforms that bitternessto goodness!Let it be a demon, He makes it into a houri, let it be a fu-neral, He makes it into a marriage -feast; and He makes knowingand world-beholding one blind from his mother’s womb.He makes the dark bright, He makes the thorn into a rose-bud; He draws the thorn out of your palm, and fashions you apillow of roses.For the sake of Abraham His friend He causes the fire toflame, and converts Nimrod’s furnace into blossoms and eglan-tine.He who gives light to the stars and succour to the helpless,He benefits His servant, and too applauds His servant.He causes all the sins of the sinners to scatter like Decem-ber leaves; into the ears of those who speak Him ill He recitesforgiveness of sin.He says, “Say, O Faithful One, pardon the sin of one whoslipped”; when a servant enters upon prayer, He secretly saysAmen.It is His amen which gives a man joy in his prayer; like a fig,He is inwardly and outwardly alike sweet and pleasant.It is rapture which in good and evil gives strength to handand foot, for this rapture mates the strength of a Rustam to thebody of a poor wretch.With rapture the poor wretch is a Rustam, without raptureRustam is one full of grief; but for rapture, how would theFriend of the Soul stablish the soul?I sent forth my heart timely (for it knows swiftly to travel theway), to carry the description of Shams-i Din to the Tabriz offidelity.  Advice from anyone is never of profit to lovers; love is notthe kind of torrent that anyone can dam up.No man of intellect will ever know the head’s ecstasy of thedrunkard; no man of reason will ever know the heart’s raptureof the reason-lost.Kings would become indifferent to kingship if they caught awhiff of those wines which lovers drink in the heart’s assembly.Khusrau bids farewell to his kingdom tor the sake of Shinn;Farhad too tor her sake strikes the axe against the mountain. Majnun flees from the circle of men of intellect tor love ofLaila; Vamiq laughed at the mustachios of every puffed-up man.Frozen is the life that has passed without that sweet spirit;rotten is the kernel that is oblivious of this almond-cake.If yonder heaven were not spinning bewildered and in lovelike us, it would grow weary of its revolving, and say, “It isenough for me; how long, how long?”The world is like a reed pipe, and He blows in its every hole;truly its every lament derives from those two sugarsweet lips.Behold how, when He blows into every clod, every heart, Hebestows a need, He bestows a passion which raises lamentationof anguish.io If you tear the heart away from God, to whom will you thencommit it? Tell me this. Soulless is the person who has beenable to tear his heart away from God for a single moment.I will make enough; go you nimbly, by night climb on to thisroof; raise a fair clamour in the city, my soul, with a loud voice!The springtide of lovers has come, that this dust bowl maybecome a garden; the proclamation of heaven has come, thatthe bird of the soul may rise in flight.  The sea becomes full of pearls, the salt marsh becomes sweetas Kauthar, the stone becomes a ruby from the mine, the bodybecomes wholly soul.If the eyes and souls of lovers are raining a flood like acloud, yet the heart within the body’s cloud is flashing likelightning.Do you know why the lovers’ eyes have become like acloud in Love? Because that moon generally is concealed inclouds.Happy and laughing hour, when those clouds have begunto weep! Lord, what a blessed state, when those lightnings arelaughing!Of those hundreds of thousands of drops, not one drop fallsupon the earth; for if it should fall upon the earth, the wholeworld would be laid in ruin.Though the whole world be laid in ruin, yet every desola-tion through love becomes fellow-mariner with Noah, and so isintimate with the Flood.Did the flood abate, the heavens would not go round;through that wave beyond direction these six directions keepin motion.You who remain fast under these six directions, at once sor-row and do not sorrow, for those seeds beneath the ground willone day become a plantation of date-trees.One day that root will raise its head from the dust, it willbecome a fresh green branch; what if two or three branchesshould wither, the rest of the tree will be pregnant withlife;And when that dry branch is set afire, the fire will be joyouslike the soul; if that is not this, it will become this; if this is notthat, it will become that.Something has closed my mouth, as if to say, “What, drunkand on the edge of the roof? Whatever it may be that bewildersyou, that thing is bewildered at Him.”  + My Beloved leaves me not so much as to scratch my ownhead; it is the body of my Beloved that presses me in its breast.Now He draws me in His train like a string of camels, anonthe King places me in front like the commander of His troops.Anon He sucks me like a seal-ring, to plant His seal throughme; anon He makes me into a ring and fastens me on His door.He takes blood and makes a sperm, He takes sperm and fash-ions a creature; He slays the creature and fashions Reason, Hemakes manifest the resurrection. Now He drives me away with a reed like a dove from thehouse, anon with a hundred entreaties He calls me to Hispresence .Now He carries me like a ship on a voyage over the sea, anonHe halts me and ties me to His own anchor.Now He makes me water for the sake of the seeker after pu-rity, anon He makes me a thorn in the path of His luckless ones.The eternal eight paradises did not become the prospect ofthat King; how happy is this heart of mine, which He makes Hisprospect!Not by the attestation of faith did I become a believer inthat Beauty of the Soul; only then did I become a believer in Itwhen I became an unbeliever in myself,io Whoever joined His ranks became secure from destructionby Him; I saw the sword in His hand, I burned that shield ofmine.I was like-pinioned with Gabriel, I had six hundred wings;now that I have reached Him, what shall I do with my wings?Many days and nights I was guardian of the pearl of my soul;now in the current of the ocean of pearls I am indifferent to myown pearl.How long will you essay to describe Him? For He comesnot within description; make enough, that I may ride over mycommotion.  The Friend is toggling me like a camel; in what train is Hedragging His drunken camel?He wounded my soul and body, He broke my glass, Hebound my neck — to what task is He drawing me?His net is carrying me like a fish to the shore; His snare isdrawing my heart towards the Master of the chase.He who makes the train of clouds, like camels under thesky, to water the plain, is drawing me over mountain andcavern. The thunder beats its drum; particle and whole have becomealive; the scent of spring is wafting in the twig’s heart and themarrow of the rose.He who makes the recesses of the seed to be the cause ofthe fruit, He is dragging the secret of the tree’s heart up to thegallows.The grace of springtide breaks the pain of the garden’s crop-sickness, even though the cruelty of winter is still drawing to-wards crop-siclcness.My heart, be seated near that person who has experience ofthe heart, go under that tree which bears fresh blossoms.Go not in every direction as do idlers in this druggists’ mar-ket; sit in the shop of someone who has sugar in his shop.If you have no balance, then every one waylays you; one manadorns a counterfeit coin, and you imagine that he has gold;Cheatingly he sets you by the door, saying, “I am com-ing” — do not sit expectant at the door, for that house has twodoors. Do not bring your cup to every pot that seethes, and do notsit there, for every seething pot has within it something else.  Not every reed holds sugar; not every under has an over; notevery eye has sight; not every sea holds pearls.Lament, singing nightingale, because the drunkard’s lamenthas some effect, some effect even on rocks and stones.Put aside your head if you have no room, for if the thread isnot contained in the eye of the needle that is because it has ahead.This wakeful heart is a lantern; hold it under your skirt; passaway from this wind and air, for the air puts it into commotion.When you have passed away from the wind you have becomea dweller in a fountain, you have become companion to a con-federate who pours cooling water on the heart.When you have water on your heart, you are like a greentree which constantly yields new fruit, and journeys within theHeart.A fair idol that all the night teaches tricks to Venus and themoon, his two eyes by witchery sew up the two eyes of heaven.Look out for your hearts, Moslems, for I at all events am socommingled with Him that no heart is commingled with me.First I was born of His love, finally I gave my heart to Him;when fruit is born of a branch, from that branch it hangs.I am fleeing from my own shadow, for the light is hiddenfrom the shadow; where shall he rest at last who flees from hisshadow?The tip of His tress is saying, “Ha, quick, to the rope-triclc!”The cheek of His candle is saying, “Where is the moth, that itmay burn?”For the sake of that rope-trick be brave, and become a hoop;fling yourself into the fire, when His candle is kindled.When you have seen the joy of burning you will no moreendure without the flame; even if the water oflife came to you,it would not stir you from the flame.  My heart is like an oyster shell, the Beloved’s phantom is thepearl; now I am no more contained, for this house is filled withHim.Night split the lip of my soul with the sweetness of His talk; Iam surprised at him who says, “Truth is bitter.”Mortals’ food comes from without, but the lover’s food isfrom within; he regurgitates and chews, for the lover is like acamel.Be swift-faring like a peri, denude yourself of your body;nakedness is not allowed to him who has the mange. Salah al-Din has come to the chase; all the lions are hisquarry; that man is his servant who is free from the two worlds. Once again the drunkards’ head from drunkenness has comeinto prostration; has perchance that minstrel of the souls struckup music from the veil?The reckless gamblers of head and soul once more are riot-ing; being has departed into annihilation, and annihilation hascome into being.Once more the world is full of the sound of Seraphiel’s trum-pet; the trustee of the unseen has become visible, for goods andchattels have come to the soul.See how the earthy particles have received fresh life; all theirearthiness has turned to purity, all their loss become gain. That world is without colour; yet out of the crucible of thesight, like light, this red and blue have issued from the colour-mixing soul.The body’s portion of this is colour, the soul’s portion isdelight; for the cauldron’s portion from the kitchen fire issmoke .  Consume, O heart, tor so long as you are raw, the scent ofthe Heart will not come from you; when did you ever knowanyone to produce the scent of incense without fire?The scent is always with the incense, it never departed orreturned thither; one man says, “It came late,” another says, “Itcame early.”The Emperor has not fled from the ranks, only the helmetand armour are a veil; the veil over his moonlike face is a helmetagainst the blows of mortals.The month of December has departed, and January too;come, for the spring has come, the earth is green and joyous,the time of the tulips has come.See how the trees stagger and shake their hands as if drunk!The zephyr has recited a spell, so that the rosebower cannot rest.The nenuphar said to the jasmine, “See how twisted togetherI am!” The blossoms said to the meadow, “The grace of theOmnipotent has descended.”The violet genuflected when the hyacinth bowed humbly,when the narcissus gave a wink, saying, “A time for taking notehas come.”What did the tossing willow say, that it became light-headedwith drunkenness? What did that fair-statured cypress behold,that it departed and returned firm of foot?The painters have taken the brush, with whose hands mysoul is intoxicated, for their lovely imageries have lent beauty tothe grove.Thousands of sweet-feathered birds seated on their pulpitsare praising and reciting lauds, that the time of divulging hascome.When the soul’s bird says “Ya Hu! ” the ringdove replies“Where, where?” The former says, “Since you have not caughtthe scent, your portion is waiting.”  The roses are bidden to show their hearts; it is not seemly tohide the heart, when the unveiling of the friend of the cave hascome.The rose said to the nightingale, “Look at the green lily —though it has a hundred tongues, it is steadfast and keeps itssecret.”The nightingale replied, “Go forth, be busy disclosing mysecret, for this love which I possess is reckless like you.”The plane-tree lowered its face to the vine — “Prostrate one,stand up!” The vine answered, “This prostrating of mine is notvoluntary.I am pregnant with that draught which smites at the drunk-ards; my inward is as fire, your outward is mere plane.”The saffron came forth gay, the mark of lovers on its cheek;the rose pitied it and said, “Ah, this poor creature, how abjectit is!”This encounter reached the ears of the laughing-faced, rubyapple, which said to the rose, “It knows not that the Beloved islongsuftering.”When the apple advanced this claim, that “I think well of theLord,” to put it to the proof stones rained from every side.Someone stoned him; if he was a true lover, he laughs; whyshould not Shinn laugh when pelted by Khusrau?The throwing of clods by the fair ones is meant for callingthe lover; the cruelty of lovers to one another is not a sign ofaversion.If Zulaikha that moment tore Joseph’s shirt and collar, knowthat it was in sport and play that she unveiled his secret.The apple absorbs the blow and comes not down, saying, “Iam happy hanging here, for this honour of being hung on highhas come upon me, like Mansur.I am Mansur hanging from the branch of the gallows of theAll-Merciful; such kissing and embracing has come upon me farfrom the lips of the vile ones.”Ho, kissing is done with; hide your heart like a turnover;within the breast utter secretly the words innumerable.iooToday your beauty has another lineament, today your delect-able lip has another sweetmeat;Today your ruby rose has sprung from another twig, todayyour cypress-stature has another loftiness.Today that moon of yours indeed is not contained in the sky,and that wheel-like die of yours has another expanse;Today I know not from which side the commotion hasarisen, I only know that through it the world has another riot. That lion-overthrowing deer — it is evident in its eyes thatoutside the two worlds it has another desert.This mad heart departed; both heart and madness becamelost, tor it has another madness loftier than this madness.If he has no foot, the lover will fly on eternal wings, and if hehas no head, the lover has other heads.The sea of the two eyes sought him and became empty; itwas not aware that another sea contains that pearl.In love I turned the two worlds upside down; why did youseek him here? For he holds another place,io My heart’s today is love, my heart’s tomorrow the Beloved;my heart’s today holds in its heart another tomorrow.If King Salah al-DIn is hidden, it is no wonder, for out ofthe jealousy of God every moment he has another master of theharem.Morn-arising friends, who is there that discovers the dawn,who discovers us dancing in confusion like atoms?Who has the luck to come to the brink of a river to drink wa-ter from that river, and to discover the reflection of the moon?Who is there that like Jacob from the shirt of Joseph seeksthe scent of his son, and instead discovers the light of his eyes? ioi Or athirst like the bedouin casts a bucket into the well, andin the bucket discovers a beauty like an ass-load of sugar?Or like Moses seeking fire, who seeks out a bush, comes togather the fire, and discovers a hundred dawns and sunrises?Jesus leaps into the house to escape from the foe; suddenlyfrom the house he discovers a passage to heaven.Or like a Soloman he splits a fish, and in the belly of that fishhe discovers a ring of gold.Sword in hand, ‘Umar comes intending to slay the Prophet;he falls into God’s snare, and discovers a kindly regard fromfortune.Or like Adham’s son he drives towards a deer to make thedeer his prey, and instead discovers another prey.Or like a thirsty oyster shell he comes with gaping mouth totake a drop of water into himself, and discovers a pearl withinhimself.Or a man foraging who turns towards desolations, and sud-denly in a desolation he discovers news of a treasure .Traveller, have done with legends, so that intimate alike andstranger may discover without your exposition the light of DidWe not open.Whoever strides sincerely towards Shams al-Din, though hisfoot may grow weary, he will discover two wings from Love.Friend, is sugar sweeter or He who makes the sugar? Friend,is the moon fairer or He who makes the moon?Forgo sugars, forgo moons; He knows something other, Hemakes something other.In the sea are marvels besides pearls, but none like the Mon-arch who makes the sea and the pearls.Besides the water is another water springing from a mar-vellous waterwheel; without flaw and unsleeping It providessustenance to the heart.   Without knowledge it is not possible to fashion an image ofa bath; how shall be that Knowledge which makes intellect andawareness?Without knowledge you cannot extract oil from fat; considerthen that Knowledge which makes sight from fat.Souls are distraught, without eating and slumber, on accountof the marvellous feast which He makes at the time of dawn.Happy dawn, when that despair of every moon makes Histwo hands a belt around my waist!Yonder sky laughs at the mustachios of that deluded one;that laughingstock makes himself an ass in the train of two orthree asses.io That ass flings himself into gold as if into barley; he is heed-less of the King who makes gems of stones.I have made enough, enough, I have quit exhalation; the restthat Darling will speak, who makes of the ear an eye.That wandering slave has returned, returned; he has comebefore You burning and melting like a candle.Smile upon him, O Soul, like anemone and sugar-candy; donot shut the door, O Soul, for he comes in need.And even if You close the door, he will submit to Your de-cree; the servant is all servile need, the king is full of pride anddisdain.Every molten candle has become the brightness of the eye,for he who has suffered melting has become privy to the secret. If I make a difference between envenomed water from Hishand and wine, in the path of the Spirit my spirit has come, byAllah, but insincerely.How should any animal drink His water of life? How shouldthe eye which is closed behold His face?I have abandoned travel, I have come to dwell with the Friend,I have become secure from death because that long life has come.  My heart, since you are in this stream why then do you stillseek tor water? How long will you say, “Come to the Feast”?The time of prayer has come.Why must I dance in the glow of His sun? So that when themote dances, He may remember me.Every atom has become pregnant of the glow of His face,every atom of that delight gives birth to a hundred atoms.Behold, in the mortar, how the body out of love for one fleetof spirit beats and bruises itself to become an atom.If you are pearl and coral, only become grain-fine here, be-cause in this presence only a mote is becoming.Behold the pearl of the soul in the oyster shell of the body,how it bites its fingers at the hand of affliction.When the spirit takes flight from you, this imprisonedessence returns to its origin like a mote — you may call to it, butit will not come.And though its load be very firm and it digs in blood, thoughfor a whole life it goes in blood, not one hair of it will be defiled.Its only dwelling place is in the well of Babylon; until thesoul becomes a magician, it reposes not in any place.Tabriz! If Shams al-Din shines forth from your zodiac, eventhe cloud will become like the moon, even the moon will wax inbrightness.Every moment the Soul is decaying and growing before you,and how should any man plead with you for the sake of a singlesoul?Wherever you set your foot a head springs from the earth; forone head’s sake how should anyone wash his hands of you?  On the day when the soul takes flight in joy at your scent, thesoul knows, the soul knows, what scent wafts from the Beloved.Once your crop-sickness diminishes from the brain, the headraises a hundred laments, every hair is groaning. I have emptied house, that I may be filled with your furni-ture; I am waning, that your love may wax and increase.My soul in the train of Shams al-Haqq-i TabrlzT is scuddinglike a ship without feet over the sea.Do not despair, my soul, for hope has manifested itself; thehope of every soul has arrived from the unseen.Do not despair, though Mary has gone from your hands, forthat light which drew Jesus to heaven has come.Do not despair, my soul, in the darkness of this prison, forthat king who redeemed Joseph from prison has come.Jacob has come forth from the veil of occlusion, Joseph whorent Zulaikha’s veil has come. You who all through night to dawn have been crying “OLord,” mercy has heard that “O Lord” and has come.O pain which has grown old, rejoice, for the cure has come;O fastened lock, open, for the key has come.You who have abstained fasting from the Table on high,break your fast with joy, for the first day of the feast has come.Keep silence, keep silence, for by virtue of the command “Be!”that silence of bewilderment has augmented beyond all speech.oDie now, die now, in this Love die; when you have died inthis Love, you will all receive new life.Die now, die now, and do not fear this death, for you willcome forth from this earth and seize the heavens.  Die now, die now, and break away from this carnal soul, forthis carnal soul is as a chain and you are as prisoners.Take an axe to dig through the prison; when you have bro-ken the prison you will all be kings and princes. Die now, die now before the beauteous King; when you havedied before the King, you will all be kings and renowned.Die now, die now, and come forth from this cloud; whenyou come forth from this cloud, you will all be radiant full moons.Be silent, be silent; silence is the sign of death; it is because oflife that you are fleeing from the silent one.The weary ones have all gone; close the door of the house;laugh all in union at aweary reason.Come forth to the Ascension, since you are of the Prophet’sfamily; kiss the cheek of the moon, since you are on a high roof.Since he split the moon, why are you clouds? Since he issprightly and neat, why are you good-for-nothing?Weary ones, why did you depart? For not like true men onthis path did you like Farhad and Shaddad in a moment cleavethrough the mountain. Since you are not moon-faced, turn not away from themoon-faced; since you are not in anguish, do not bandage yourown heads.Like that it did happen and like this; so it comes not right;do not know how you are, do not know how many you are!When you beheld that fountain, why did you not becomewater? When you saw that Self, why did you approve your ownselves?Since you are in the mine of sugarcane, why are you sour offace? Since you are in the Water of Life, why are you dry andwithered?Do not contend so, do not flee from felicity; what possibilityof flight is there, seeing that you are in the toils of the lasso?  io You are caught in the lasso from which there is no security;do not writhe, do not writhe, do not scrape against the shuttle.Like self-sacrificing moths rub against this candle; why areyou dedicated to the companion? Why are you attached to thechain?Burn at this candle, light up your heart and soul, put on anew body when you have flung away this old one.Why are you afraid of the fox? You are of lion stock. Why areyou lame asses, since you are of the loins of the swift horse?The Friend Himself is coming, the door of felicity is open-ing, for that friend is the key; you are all locks. Be silent, for speech has swallowed you down; the purchaseris like a parrot, and you are all sugar-candy.Since your image dwelt within the house of our breasts,wherever we sit has become like highest paradise.Those thoughts and imaginings that were as Gog andMagog — each one has become like a houri’s cheek and a dollof China.That image on account of which men and women all weep,if it was once an evil companion, has now become an excellentcompanion.Above all a garden has grown, below all is a treasure — whatmanner of thing are you, that through you the world has be-come so? From that day when we beheld him we augment daily; thethorn that sought him out has become a veritable rosebower.Every unripe grape has become a ripe grape from the sun andhas become full of sugar, and that black stone too through thesun has become a precious ruby.Many an earth there is that by God’s preference has becomea heaven, many a left hand through the palm of divine favourhas become a right hand.  If once he was darkness to the heart, now he has become theheart’s window; if once he was a footpad of the faith, now hehas become the leader of religion.If it was the well of calamity that was Joseph’s prison, onaccount of his coming forth it became the firm cord.Every particle like the army of God is subject to God’s com-mand; to the servant of God it has proved security, to the infidelit has become as an ambush.Silence! For your speech is as the Nile — to the Copts likeblood, to the Israelites a pure well.Silence! For your speech is a ripe fig, only not every bird ofthe air is suitable for figs.At the dawn hour a moon appeared in the sky, came downfrom the sky and gazed upon me.Like a hawk which seizes a bird at the time of hunting, thatmoon snatched me up and ran over the sky.When I gazed at myself I saw myself no more, because inthat moon my body through grace became like the soul.When I voyaged in soul I saw naught but the moon, so thatthe secret of the eternal revelation was all disclosed.The nine spheres of heaven were all absorbed in that moon,the ship of my being was entirely hidden in the sea.That sea surged, and Reason arose again and cast abroad avoice; thus it happened and so it befell.That sea foamed, and at every foam-fleck something tookform and something was bodied forth.Every foam-fleck of body which received a sign from that seamelted forthwith and became spirit in that sea.Without the royal fortune of Shams al-Din of Tabriz onecould neither behold the moon nor become the sea.  Birds, who are now parted from your cage, show your facesagain and declare where you are.Your ship has stopped on this water, wrecked; like fishes, lorone instant rise from this water.Is it that the mould has broken and rejoined that Friend? Orhas the trap slipped out of hand, and you are parted from theprey?Are you today fuel to that fire of yourselves? Or has the firein you died, and are you the light of God? Has that wind become a pestilence and congealed you? Orhas it become the breeze of the zephyr, wherever you enter?There is an answer from your souls in every word that pro-ceeds, even though you may not open your mouths to answer.How many pearls you have broken in the mortar of the days!That is surmeh {collyrium} to the eyes; pound on, pound on!You who have been born when you arrived at death, this is asecond birth — be born, be born!Whether you are born Hindu or Turk a second time willbecome clear on the day when you remove the veil,io And if it be that you have been worthy of Shams al-Haqq ofTabriz, by Allah, you are the high chamberlains of the day ofretribution.Though the whole world be full of thorns, the heart of thelover is wholly a rosebower;And though heaven’s wheel be idle and ineffective, the worldof lovers is fully employed.Let all other men be sorrowful, yet the lover’s soul will begay and happy and sprightly.Give to the lover every place where a candle is extinguished,  for he is endowed with a hundred thousand lights. Even if the lover is alone, he is not alone, for his is compan-ioned by the hidden Beloved.The wine of lovers bubbles up from the breast; love’s com-panion is in the inmost secrets.Love is not content with a hundred promises, for the cun-ning of the heart-enchanters is manifold.And if you should see a lover sick, is not the fair one at thesick one’s head?Be a rider of love, and fear not the way, for love’s steed isswift of pace;io With a single bound it brings you to the abode, even thoughthe road be not even.The soul of the lover knows nothing of fodder-eating, forthe souls of lovers are vintners of fine wine.In Shams al-DTn-i Tabrlzl you will discover a heart which isat once intoxicated and very sober.Rajab has gone out and Sha‘ban has entered; the soul hasquit the body, and the Beloved has entered.The breath of ignorance and the breath of heedlessness havegone forth; the breath of love and the breath of forgivenesshave entered.The heart is sprouting roses and eglantine and basil, sincefrom the cloud of generosity rain has arrived.The mouths of all the sorrowful ones are laughing because ofthis candy which has entered the teeth. Man is wearing gold brocade like the sun, since that gold-scattering moon-faced one has entered.Clap hands and speak, minstrel oflove, for that ringleader oftrouble has entered stamping feet.If yesterday has gone, may today remain forever, and if‘Umar has departed, ‘Uthman has entered. no All the past life is returning, since this eternal prosperity hasentered.If you are drunk and asleep in the ship of Noah, why shouldyou worry if the Flood has arrived?The earth of Tabriz has become lit up like the sky, sinceShams al-DIn has entered that maidan {= arena, square}.We have departed — may the remainder long remain! In-escapably every man who has been born must depart.Heaven’s bowl has never seen any dish that did not in theend fall from the roof.Do not run about so, for in this earth the pupil has becomeeven as the master.Lovely one, put not on airs, for in this grave many a Shinnhas become naughted, the same as Farhad.After all, what constancy is there in an edifice whose columnsare but fragments of wind?If we were evil, we carried away evil; if we were good, thenmay you remember!Though you may be the unique one of your time, today youwill be departing as one by one.If you do not wish to remain alone, make children of obedi-ence to God and good actions.That thread of unseen light is immortal, because it is the pithof the spirit of the Pegs;That essence of love, which is the quintessence — that remainsto all eternity.If these shifting sands are unstable, another kind of founda-tion is laid down.I am like Noah’s ark in this dry land, fc>r that flood is thesealing of the promised time.Noah made his house an ark, because he saw from the un-seen the wave overtowering. HI We have fallen asleep amongst the silent ones, because wehave passed all bounds in clamour and lamentation.That Joseph handsome of cheek has come, that Jesus of theage has come;That banner of a hundred thousand victories has come flut-tering over the cavalcade of spring.You whose business it is to bring the dead to life, arise, forthe day of work has come.The lion which seizes lions a-hunting has come into themeadowland raging drunk.Yesterday and the day before have departed; seize the cash,for that coin of fair assay has come.This city today is like paradise; it is saying, “The Prince hascome.”Beat the drum, for it is the day of festival; be joyous, for theFriend has come.A moon has lifted its head out of the unseen, in comparisonwith which this moon has become as dust;Because of the beauty of those souls’ repose, the wholeworld has become resdess.Take heed, spread open the skirt oflove, for sprinkling hascome from the ninth heaven.O exile bird with cut pinions, in the place of two wings fourhave come.Ho, heart bound in breast, open, for that lost one has comeinto your bosom.Foot, come and stamp foot, for that illustrious cupbearer hascome.Speak not of the old man, for he has become young, andspeak not of yesteryear, for the Friend has come.You said, “What excuse shall I utter to the king?” The kinghimself has come making excuses. You said, “Whither shall I escape out of his hand?” His handhas come bringing all succour.You saw a fire, and light has come; you saw blood, and redwine has come.That one who was fleeing from his own fortune, having fled,has come back shamefaced.Be silent, and count not his graces; an innumerable grace it isthat has come.We have become drunk and our heart has departed, it hasfled from us — whither has it gone?When it saw that the chain of reason was broken, immedi-ately my heart took to flight.It will not have gone to any other place, it has departed tothe seclusion of God.Seek it not in the house, for it is of the air; it is a bird of theair, and has gone into the air.It is the white falcon of the Emperor; it has taken flight, anddeparted to the Emperor.We are foes to ourselves, and friends to him who slays us;we are drowned in the sea, and the waves of the sea are slay-ing us.For this reason, laughing and gay, we are yielding up sweetlife, because that king is slaying us with honey and sugar andsweetmeat.We make ourselves out fat for the sacrifice of the feast, be-cause that butcher of lovers slays the very fine and handsome.That Iblis without light begs for a respite from Him; Hegave him respite, because He is slaying him after tomorrow.  Like Ishmael, cheerfully lay your neck before the knife; donot steal your throat away from Him, if He is slaying, until Heslays.Azrael has no power or way to overcome lovers; love itselfand passion slays the lovers of love.The slain ones shout, “Would that my people knew”; se-credy the Beloved bestows a hundred lives, and openly slays.Put forth a head out of the earth of the body, and then seethat He is either drawing you to heaven, or slaying you.The spirit of breath He takes away, the comfort spiritual Hebestows; He releases the falcon of the soul, and slays the owl ofsorrow.That idea the Christian carries abroad, the Moslem has notthat idea, that He is slaying this Messiah upon the cross.Every true lover is like Mansur, they slay themselves; showany beside the lover who deliberately slays himself!Death daily makes a hundred requisitions on mankind; thelover of God without requisition slays himself.I make this enough, else I will myself utter the secret of thelovers’ {death}, though the unbeliever slays himself of angerand fury.Shams-i TabrizI has climbed over the horizon like the sun;unceremoniously he is extinguishing the candles of the stars.Behold, those birds which lay golden eggs every morningsaddle the swift colt of the skies.When they gallop, the seventh heaven is their arena; whenthey sleep, they {make their pillow} the sun and the moon.They are fishes, in the soul of each one of which is a Jonah;they are rosebushes which beautify and order well the skies.Hell-tasters, heaven-givers, on the day of resurrection theyare the rulers, they know neither any blessing nor utter any im-precation.  They set the mountains dancing of subtlety in the air, andconvert the seas in sweetness to be like sweet sugar.They make bodies souls, and souls everlasting; they makestones into ruby mines, and unbelief into faith.They are more manifest than all, and more hidden than all; ifyou wish to behold them, they make themselves visible beforeyour eyes.If you wish to behold clearly, make surmeh {collyrium} ofthe dust of their feet; for they cause him who was blind from hismother’s womb to see the way.If you are a thorn, be sharp of point as a thorn in the quest,that they may convert your whole thorn into the likeness ofroses and eglantine.If there were scope for speech, I would utter things that maybe spoken, so that the spirits and the angels would applaud outof heaven.Last night our elephant remembered India again, in frenzyhe was rending the veil of night till dawn.Last night the flagons of the sakis were all overbrimming —O may our life be like last night till the day of resurrection!The wines were bubbling and the reasons were senseless onaccount of him; may part and whole, thorn and rose be happybecause of his lovely face!The cup-on-cup clamour of the drunkards mounted toheaven; in our hands was the wine, and in our heads the wind.Thousands of uproars fell upon the skies because of these, therehundreds of thousands of Kai-Qubads were fallen prostrate.The day of triumph and good fortune was contained in ournight; of the brethren of purity night suddenly gave birth tosuch a day.The sea broke into waves; heaven received a token of thisnight, and in pride set that token on its head and face.  Whatever ways humanity had closed in darkness, the light ofdivinity in compassion was opening up.How should the sensible forms on account of that passionremain in place? How should he remain in place who attainsthis desire?Begin life anew, Moslems! For the Beloved has convertednon-entity into being, and dispensed justice to the lovers.Our Beloved henceforward holds the fallen to be pardon-able, because wherever He is the saki no one remains on theright course.The surging of the sea of grace, Moslems, has wrecked thepomp of personal effort and the programme of belief.That grace is King Salah al-Din, for he is a Joseph whom theLord of Egypt himself must purchase at a great price.I have come to lay my face in the dust of the Beloved’s feet,I have come to beg pardon for a moment for my actions.I have come to take up anew the service of His rose bower,I have come to bring fire and set my thorns alight.I have come to get purification from the dust of all that haspassed, to reckon my good deeds as evil as performed in thecause of my Beloved;I have come with eyes weeping, that my eyes may beholdparadise — fountains consisting of the love of that blandisher ofmine.Rise, disencumbered passion, take up love anew; I have diedand become void of my old faith and unbelief;For without your straining-cloth it is impossible to becomeunsullied in existence, without You it is impossible ever to es-cape from one’s sorrows and griefs.Outwardly I have fallen silent; but You know that inwardlyI have bloodstained speech in my blood -consuming heart. In this state of silence examine well my face, that You maysee on my cheeks a myriad traces of yourself.I have shortened this ode; the rest of it is in my heart; I willutter it, if You intoxicate me with your vintner eye.O silent from speaking, O you sundered from your mate,how did you become thus distraught from your clever reason?Silent one, how are you faring with these fiery thoughts?Thoughts are arriving with their huge -panoplied army.When people are alone, they are silent; one speaks with men,no one speaks the secret of his heart to door and wall.Perchance you find no men to talk with, that you have fallensilent? Perchance you see no man to be intimate with your words?Are you haply of the pure world? Do not you mix with mate-rial things, with dogs of natural being who are defiled with theirown carrion?The dead would rend his shroud and rise from the tomb, ifthat dead man had tidings of my Idol.What will dead and living do when he discovers somethingof Him? For if the mountain beheld Him, it would leap andadvance.I will not flee from blame, for the blame comes from you;from your bitterness all the taste of sugar comes to the soul.Devour whatever has come to you, leave it not to store up,for you are on the banks of a running stream — when you havedrunk, more will come .Behold His fair handiwork, listen to His inspiration to thehearts; become entirely light of vision — all rapture comes fromvision.Do not despair, saying, “My life is gone, and the Friend hasnot come”; He comes betimes and out of season, He comes notonly at dawn.  Be watchful and wakeful in season and out of season, forsuddenly our King enters the eyes like ‘UzaizI antimony.When He enters this eye, this eye becomes like the sea; whenHe gazes on the sea, out of all its waters pearls come;Not such a dead pearl that knows not its own essence, pearlswill come all speaking, all seeking, altogether alive.What do you know, what do you know what kind of mindand soul you are? It is God who knows and sees the virtue thatbelongs to men.Become accustomed to speak without lips, like a balance, torlips and teeth do not remain when one passes from the world.Say, do not despair because the Beloved drives you away; ifHe drives you away today, will He not call you back tomorrow?If He shuts the door on you, do not go away; be patientthere, for after patience He will seat you in the place of honour.And if He bars against you all ways and passages, He willshow you a secret way, which no man knows.Is it not the case that when the butcher cuts off the head of asheep with his knife, he does not abandon what he has slain, butfirst slays, and then draws?When no more breath remains to the sheep, he fills it withhis own breath; you will see whither God’s breath will bringyou!I spoke this as a parable; else, His generosity slays no man,rather it rescues him from slaying.He gives all the kingdom of Solomon to a single ant; Hebestows both worlds, and does not startle a single heart.My heart has travelled round the world and found none likeHim; whom does He resemble? Whom does He resemble?Ah, silence! For without speech He gives to all of this wineto taste, He gives to taste, He gives to taste, He gives to taste. h Ho, lovers, labour so that, when body and soul remain nomore, your hearts may fly to heaven, not remain heavy like thebody.Wash your hearts and souls in the water of wisdom clean ofdust, ho, that the two eyes of regret may not remain turnedtowards the earth.Is it not the case with everything in the world, that love isits vital soul? Apart from love, everything you see remains noteternally.Your nonexistence (before birth) is as the east, your death isas the west, oriented to another heaven that resembles not thisvisible heaven. The way to heaven is within; shake the wings of love — whenlove’s wings have become strong, there is no need to troubleabout a ladder.Consider not the world that exists without, for the trueworld is within the eye; when you have shut your eyes on theworld, the world will not remain.Your heart is like a roof, and your senses are waterspouts;drink water from the roof, for the waterspout remains not forever.Recite entirely this ode from the tablet of the heart; regardnot the tongue, for lips and tongue do not remain.Man’s body is a bow, breath and speech are as its arrows;once the arrows and quiver have gone, no more work remainsfor the bow.All slept, and yet sleep did not transport me, heart-forlorn asI am; all night my eyes counted the stars in the sky.Sleep had so departed from my eyes as if never to return;   my sleep had quaffed the poison of separation from you, andexpired.How would it be if you concocted a remedy out of encoun-ter for one wounded, who has committed his heart and eyes toyour hands?No, it is not right to close the door of beneficence once andfor all; if you will not give pure wine, less than one mouthful ofdregs will you not give?God has placed all manners of delight in a single chamber;no man without you ever found the right way into thatchamber.If I have become dust in the path of love, regard me not asinsignificant; how should he who beats on the door of unionwith you be insignificant?Fill my sleeve with unseen pearls — a sleeve which has wipedmany a tear from these eyes.Whenever the policeman of love has constrained anyone ona dark night, your moon has compassionately pressed him in itssilvery bosom.If the wandering heart returns of your grace, it is the story ofthe night, the disk of the moon, the camel, and the Kurd.Were not these inanimates originally of water? The world is acold place; it came and congealed one by one.Our blood in our body is the water of life, and sweet; when itcomes forth from its place, see how it is all the same!Do not congeal the water of speech, and bring it not from thatfountain, so that it is silk on that side and striped cloth on this.Have you heard that sugar has become cheap in the town?Have you heard that winter has vanished and summer is here?Have you heard that basil and carnation in the garden arelaughing surreptitiously because affairs have become easy?  Have you heard that the nightingale has returned from histravels, joined in the concert and become the master of all thebirds?Have you heard that now in the garden the branches ofthe trees have heard glad news of the rose, and shake theirhands? Have you heard that the soul has become drunk from thecup of spring, and gone off gay and dancing into the Sultan’ssanctuary?Have you heard that the anemone’s cheeks are suffused withblood? Have you heard that the rose has become head cham-berlain of the divan?Have you heard about the thievishness of mad December,how the just officer of spring has come, and he has disappeared?These idols have obtained laissez-passer from the divan, sothat the earth has become green and arrayed in full splendour.If the beauties of the garden last year wrought wonders, eachone this year has emerged in beauty a hundredfold as great.io Rose-cheelced ones have come forth whirling out of non-existence, such that the stars in heaven are but scatter beforetheir feet.The deposed narcissus has become the inspector of the king-dom; the infant bud like Jesus has become understanding andchanting.The feast of these creatures of joy has once more taken onornament; once more the breeze of the zephyr bestows wine onthe garden.There were images hidden behind the veil of the heart; theorchards have become mirrors to the secret of their hearts.Whatever you behold, seek from the heart, do not seek fromthe mirror; the mirror may receive an image, but it cannot be-come alive. All the dead ones of the garden have come to life at the sum-mons of God; their unbelief by God’s mercy has all been turnedto faith.  They are continuing in their shrouds, and are all stirring, forthat which is alive cannot become pledged tor ever to prison;He said, “Make this enough, tor I will expound this betterthan this.” I shut my mouth, for He had come and becomesurety.The King’s lips will likewise describe all completely, if thesummary has departed from you into the bosom of concealment.This fledgling pigeon essayed the air and flew off when heheard a whisde and a call from the unseen.When that Desire of all the world sent a messenger saying,“Come to Me,” how should not the disciple’s soul take flight?How should it not fly upwards on discovering such pinions,how should it not rend the body’s robe on the arrival of such amissive?What a moon it is that draws all these souls! What a way isthat secret way by which it drew!Divine compassion sent a letter saying, “Come back hither,for in this narrow cage your soul has fluttered much.But in the house without doors you are like a bird withoutwings; so the fowl of the air does when it has fallen low.Restlessness opens to it the door of compassion at last; beatyour wings against door and roof — this is the key.Until you call on Me, you do not know the way ofreturning; for by Our calling the way becomes manifest to thereason.”Whatever mounts up, if it be old it becomes new; whatevernew descends here, through time it becomes threadbare.Ho, strut proudly into the unseen, do not look back, inGod’s protection, for there all is profit and increase.Ha, silent one, depart to the Saki of Being, who gave youHis pure wine in this sullied cup.  IOOLord, is this sweet scent coming from the meadow of thesoul, or is it a breeze wafting from beyond the world?Lord, from what homeland does this water of life bubble up?Lord, from what place comes this light of the attributes?Amazing! Does this clamour arise from the troop of theangels? Amazing! Does this laughter come from the houris ofparadise?What concert is it, that the soul spins round dancing? Whatwhisde is it, that the heart is coming flapping wings?What a marriage feast it is! What a wedding! Heaven is like acurtain; the moon with this plate of gold for a sign is coming.What a hunt! For the arrow of fate is flying; if it is not so,why comes the sound of the bow?Good news, good news, lovers all! Clap your hands, for hewho once escaped from your hands is coming clapping.From the fortress of the skies the cry of “safe quarter” is aris-ing, and from the sea such a wave of fear is coming.The eye of prosperity is intoxicated with your approaching;this is a proof that is obvious to the eye.Escape from this world of dearth, where lances strike for thesake of two or three loaves.What is fairer than life? Yet if life should go, have no fear;why do you grieve about its departing, seeing that better than itis coming?Every man is amazed at something; my amazement is, howit is that when He enters the midst, He is not contained in themidst.Let me have done. Though it is a cipher, I will not explainit; what are you trying to explain? The soul of explanation iscoming.  IOIAmazing keeper of the hot baths! When he comes forth fromseclusion, every painted figure of the baths falls into prostration!The figures, frozen, unconscious, dead — from the reflectionof his eyes their eyes open large as narcissi.Through his ears their ears become familiar with fables,through his eyes their eyes become receptive of vistas.You behold every single bath-figure drunk and dancing, likea boon companion who from time to time plunges in red wine. The courtyard of the baths is full of their clamour and shout-ing; the riotous clamour marks the first day of resurrection.The figures call one another unto themselves; one figurefrom that corner there comes laughing to another figure .But no form discovers the bath-keeper himself, tor all thatform is running hither and thither in search of him.All are distracted, he behind and before them, unrecognized,the king of the souls comes at the head of the army.The rosebed of every mind is filled with roses from hischeeks; the skirt of every beggar is filled with gold from hishand.io Hold your basket before him, that he may fill it of himself,so that the basket of your poverty may become the despair ofSanjar.Judge and plaintiff alike flee from less and more, when thatmoon for one moment enters drunk into the assembly.The wine becomes the tavern, the dead become riotousdrunk, the wood becomes the Moaning Pillar when he entersthe pulpit.He denies them his presence, and their forms freeze, theireyes vanish, their ears become deaf.When he appears again their eyes open, the garden becomesfull of birds, the orchard is verdant. Go to the rosebed and the garden, behold the friends and thechatter; in the wake of this expression the soul comes to that pass.  How can one tell what was manifested, friend? How can thepen indite that, tor all that it enters the inkholder?Little by little the drunkards congregate, little by little thewine -worshippers arrive.The heart-cherishers coquettishly come along the way, therosy-cheelced ones are arriving from the garden.Little by little from the world of being and not-being thenot-beings have departed and the beings are arriving.All with skirts full of gold as a mine are arriving tor the sakeof the destitute. The lean and sick from the pasturage of love are arriving fatand hale.The souls of the pure ones like the rays of the sun are arrivingfrom such a height to the lowly ones.Blessed is that garden, where, tor the sake of the Mary’s, newfruits are arriving even in winter.Their origin is grace, and their return is grace; even from thegarden to the garden they are coming.Laughter tells of your lovingkindness, tears complain of yourwrath;These two mutually contrary messages relate in this worldabout a single Beloved.Lovingkindness beguiles a heedless man in such a way thathe is not anxious about wrath, and commits sin;The other man wrath endows with hopelessness, so that hekeeps complete despair. Love, like a pitying intercessor, comes to the protection ofboth these lost souls.  We give thanks tor this love, O God, which performs infinitelovingkindnesses;Whatever shortcomings in our gratitude we may be guilty of,love suffices to make amends for it.Is this love Kauthar, or the Water of Life? It makes life with-out bound and term;Between the sinner and God, like the Messenger, it runsmuch to and fro and busies itself greatly.Make an end of verse on verse; do not recite this; love itselfwill interpret the verse.The lovers visible and the Beloved invisible — who ever sawsuch a love in all the world?Not one lip having attained the form of the Beloved, hun-dreds of thousands of souls have expired.Two bowshots’ distance shot an arrow from the heights, sothat it tore through the shields of the skies.Not having drawn the skirt of the Beloved of the Unseen,the hearts of thousands have suffered tribulation andbeating;Not having bitten the lip of Him whose lip is sweet, howmany have bitten the back of the hand in banishment!Not having grazed on the sugar-cane of His lip, the heart hasgrazed on His thousands of blandishments.Not one rose having blossomed from His rosegarden, hun-dreds of thousands of thorns have pricked in the breast.Though the soul has experienced nothing but crueltyfrom Him, it has fled away from mortal fidelities in hope ofHim;It has preferred that pain over generosities, and has chosenthat cruelty above all fidelities.His thorn has triumphed over all roses, His lock is more de-lightful than a hundred keys.  His tyranny has carried off the ball from the turn of goodfortune; candies have blossomed from the poison of His wrath.His rejection is better than the reception of others; ruby andpearl are desirous of His stone.These worldly happinesses are nothing; seek that happinesswhich Bu SaTd possesses.These augmentations of this world are less; seek that aug-mentation which Ba Yazld possesses.That augmentation is your six-fingered hand; its value is less,though apparendy it is augmenting.Seek that radiance which Sana’I expounded, that UniqueOne whose uniqueness ‘Attar revealed.Fat and sweet food appear pure and good; one night theypassed with you, and became filth.Eat the fat and sweet of the food of love, that your wingsmay sprout and you may know how to fly.After all, Abraham as a child in the cave sucked from the fin-gertips of a lion.Dismiss that; that foetus in the womb sucked the water of lifefrom blood.The tall stature which heaven made upright in the end be-came bowed like the crooked heaven;The tall stature which Love raised up, its stature transcendedthe glorious Throne.Nay, be silent; He who knows all secrets is present; He said,We are nearer than the jugular vein.Our death is an eternal wedding-feast; what is the secret ofthis? He is God, One.The sun became dispersed through the windows; the win-dows became shut, and the numbers departed.Those numbers which existed in the grapes are naughted inthe juice which flows from the grapes.  Whosoever is living by the light of God, the death of thisspirit is replenishment to him. Speak not evil, speak not good regarding those who havepassed away from good and evil.Fix your eye on God, and speak not of what you have notseen, that He may implant another eye in your eye.That eye is the eye of the eye, nothing unseen or secret es-capes from it.When its gaze is by the Light of God, to such a light whatcan be hidden?Though all lights are the Light of God, call not all of thosethe eternal Light.io Eternal light is that which is the Light of God, transient lightis the attribute of flesh and body.The light in this mortal eye is a fire, save for that eye whichGod anoints with surmeh {collyrium}.His fire became light for the sake of Abraham; the eye ofreason became in quality like the eye of an ass.O God, the bird of the eye which has seen Your bounty fliesin Your air.The Pole, he who is the sky of the skies, is on the lookout insearch of You; Either grant him vision to see You, or do not dismiss him onaccount of this fault.Make tearful the eye of your soul every moment, guard itagainst the snare of human stature and cheek.Eye asleep and yourself wakeful — such a sleep is perfectionand rectitude;But the eye asleep that finds no interpretation (ofdreams) — expel it from sleep, despite envy.Else it will labour and be boiling in the fire of love of theOne, even to the grave.  ioEverywhere the scent of God is coming — see how the peopleare coming uncontrollably;From him for whom all souls are athirst, to the thirsty the cryof the water carrier is coming.They are milk drinkers of divine generosity, and are on thewatch to see from whence the mother is coming.They are in separation, and all are waiting to see whenceunion and encounter are coming.From Moslems, Jews, and Christians alike every dawn thesound of prayer is coming;Blessed is that intelligence into whose heart’s ear fromheaven the sound of “Come hither” is coming.Keep your ear clean of scum, for a voice is coming fromheaven;The defiled ear hears not that sound — only the deservinggets his deserts.Defile not your eye with human cheek and mole, for thatEmperor of eternal life is coming;And if it has become defiled, wash it with tears, for the curecomes from those tears.A caravan of sugar has arrived from Egypt; the sound of foot-fall and bells is coming.Fla, be silent, for to complete the ode our speaking King iscoming.Again the sun of felicity has mounted to heaven, again thedesire of the souls has arrived from the way of the soul.Again by the good pleasure of Ridwan the gates of paradisehave been opened, every spirit is plunged up to its neck in thepool of Kauthar.  Again that King, who is the altar to whom kings turn, hasentered, again that Moon surpassing the moon has entered.These distraught by mad passion have all mounted theirsteeds, for that King, the unique cavalier, has entered the heartof the army.The particles of dark earth are all bewildered and amazed,having heard from placelessness the cry, “Arise, the resurrectionhas come!”The inexpressible proclamation has come, not from within andnot from without, not left, not right, not behind, not from before.You say, “What direction is that?” That direction wherethere is questing. You say, “Whither shall I turn my face?”Thither this head has come;Thither whence this ripeness came upon the fruits, thitherwhence the attributes of gems came upon the stones;Thither where the dry fish came to life before Khidar, thitherwhence Moses’ hand became as a radiant moon.This burning in our hearts has become bright as a candle,this decree has come upon our heads like a crown of pride .The soul has not leave to utter this exposition, else everyinfidel would have escaped from unbelief.The unbeliever in hardship turns his lace thither; when heexperiences pain on this side, he believes in that side.Continue in pain, that pain may show you the road thither;that place who sees? The man who is constrained by pain.That most mighty Emperor has closed the door fast; todayhe has put on human apparel and entered by the door.The sea can always dispense with the fish, for in comparisonwith the sea the fish is contemptible.You will not find fish, my soul, like the sea of the ocean; inthe sea of God’s ocean there are many fish.  The sea is like a nurse, the fish like a sucking child; thewretched infant is always weeping for milk.Yet tor all this indifference, if the sea should compassionatelyincline towards a fish, great will be the grace;And that fish which knows that the sea is seeking him — hisfoot in pride rises above the ether.That fish which — the sea does no task without the fish’sopinion is its counsellor —You might say that so highly favoured a fish is an emperor,and that infinite sea is his minister.If anyone should dare to call him a fish, every drop in hiswrath would be as an arrow.How long will you speak in riddles? Your riddles bring be-wilderment; expound a little more clearly, that the heart mayperceive.Worshipful Shams-i Din is both Lord and Master, for by himthe earth of Tabriz is all musk and ambergris.Should the thorns of the world behold his graces, in softnessand delicacy they would become like silk.May I never have a soul, if my soul after tasting his wine andbeing drunk with his beauty is self-aware.There was no grace left which that fair idol did not perform;what fault is it of ours, if he acted not generously towards you?You are upbraiding because that beauty was cruel; whoeversaw a lovely one in both worlds who acted not cruelly?His love is sugar enough, even if he gave not sugar; hisbeauty is all fidelity, even if he was not faithful.Show me a house that is not filled with lamps of him; showme a portico which his cheek has not filled with brightness.This eye and that lamp are two lights, each one on its own;when the two met, none made parting between them. HI When the spirit became lost in contemplation, it said this:“None has contemplated the beauty of God but God.”Each one of these similitudes is at once an exposition andan error; only out of jealousy God named His Face, By theForenoon.The sun of the face of Shams al-DIn, Pride of Tabriz, nevershone on aught transient but it made it eternal.noThe fire the day before yesterday whispered secredy to thesmoke, “The aloes-wood cannot rest without me, and with meit is happy.It knows well my worth, and expresses thanks to me, for thealoes-wood has perceived that in its passing away there is profit.The aloes-wood was knotted and tied from head to foot; inthe release of nonexistence these knots were resolved.Hail and welcome to you, my flame-eating friend, my passer-away and martyr and pride of all witnesses.”See how heaven and earth are pawns of existence; flee intononexistence from the blindness of the one and the blueness ofthe other.Every soul which flees away from poverty and nonexistence ismisfortune fleeing away from prosperity and good fortune.Without expunging, no one profits from the tablet of nonex-istence; make peace between me and expunging, O loving One!Until yonder dark earth passed away from itself, it did notbegin to augment or escape from inertia.So long as sperm was sperm and did not become obliteratedfrom seminal fluid, it attained not the cypress’ stature nor thecheeks’ beauty.When bread and broth ferment in the intestines, they thenbecome reason and soul, the despair of the envious.So long as black rock did not pass away from itself, it did notbecome gold and silver, neither found its way into coins.  First comes lowliness and bondage, then afterwards there iskingship; in the ritual prayer men first stand, and then sit.For a lifetime you have made trial of your own being; once itis also necessary to experience not-being.The pomp and pride of poverty and passing-away is noempty boast; whenever smoke appears, it is not without a fire.If our minds and desires belong not to love, how did lovewantonly rob us of heart and turban?Love entered, and draws us along by the ear every morningto the school of those who fulfil their covenants.Love sets flowing the water of penitence from the eye ofthe believer, to wash his breast clean of anger and stubborndenial.You are fallen asleep and the water of Khidar splashes besideyou; leap up from slumber and seize the goblet of immortality.Let love tell you the rest of it secretly from me; be one withthe Companions of the Cave, alike sleeping and waking.IllThe sweetheart appeared asleep. I called from the garden,“Quick, I have stolen a peach!” The sweetheart in fact was notasleep;He laughed and said, “The fox then with cunning — how didit so easily steal the quarry from the lion’s hands?”Who milks a cloud? Who succeeds in reaching there, unlessperchance the cloud of itself shows generosity?How can the nonexistent contrive to bring into existence? Itis God’s bounty that bestows existence on the nonexistent.Sit as if nonexistent; for in ritual prayer one only gives thegreeting when seated.It is through humility that water avails against fire, for firestands up whereas water is prostrate.When the lip is silent, the heart has a hundred tongues; besilent — how long, how long do you desire to make trial of Him?  Dawn has arrived and drawn his polished blade, and fromheaven camphor-white morn has broken forth.The Sufi of the skies has rent his blue robe and shawl deliber-ately even to the navel.After being routed, the master of day having found thestrength has dragged the Zangi of night from the royal throne .From that direction whence the Turk of joy and the Hinduof grief arrived there is everlasting going and coming, and theway is not to be seen. O Lord, whither has the army of the Abyssinian king fled?Whence so suddenly has the army of the Caesar of Rum arrived?Who can catch the scent of this invisible road wrapped inenigma? He who has drunk or tasted of the wine oflove pre-eternal.Night is bewildered at who has blackened its face; day is be-wildered at who has created it so fair.Earth is bewildered at how one half of it became grass, andthe other half grazing, and grazed upon that continually;Half of it became eater and half for eating, half eager for pu-rity and the other half impure .io Night has died and come to life again; it is life after death. Osorrow, slay me, for I am Husain and you are Yazld.The pearl held auction, saying, “Who will buy this?” Nonehad the price, so the pearl bought itself from itself.Saki, today we have all become your guests; every nightthrough you has become a Night of Power, every day a day offestival.Give from your bowl the wine of they shall be given to drinkof pure wine, for only new joy will cut away anxiety.The heart-thirsty reprobates, when they drink wine to excess,when they lose themselves, then they find that key. You have taken up your station beside the vat of Unity alongwith Noah and Lot and Karkhi and Shibll and Ba Yazid.  Be silent; for the spirit in joy is flapping its wings, so that thatdraught has coursed into the head and veins of the spirit.Unbelief has put on black garments; the Light of Muham-mad has arrived. The drum of immortality has been beaten; theeternal kingdom has arrived.The face of earth is turned green; heaven has rent her robe;once again the moon is split; the incorporeal spirit has arrived.The world is filled with sugar; happiness has bound its waist;arise, for once again that moon-cheelted one has arrived.The heart like an astrolabe has become the token of theseven heavens; the commentary on the heart of Ahmad has ar-rived in seven volumes.One night shackled reason approached the sultan oflove,saying, “Fettered spirit has arrived to your good favour.”The messenger of the lovers’ hearts ran head-downwards likea pen; the good tidings sweet as sugar have arrived in the heartof the page .How long will the pure spirits endure under the earth? Ho,leap forth from the tomb — God-assisted victory has arrived.The drum of resurrection has been beaten, the trumpet ofuprising is sounding; the time has come, you dead ones — themustering renewed has arrived.Scattered is what is in the tombs, known is what is in thebreasts; the voice of the trumpet has sounded; the spirit hasarrived at its goal.Last night a tumult arose amongst the stars, for the mostauspicious star arrived from the propitious ones.Mercury became out of control, he broke the Tablet andthe Pen; in his wake Venus leaped, drunken arrived at the PoleStar.The moon’s orb grew pale, she fled towards Leo. I said, “Itrust all is well”; she said, “The unselfed saki has arrived.”  Reason in the midst of that tumult desired to show itself; achild is still a child, even if it has arrived at the ABC.Arise, for this is our turn, the King of the world is ours; sinceHis gaze fell upon our souls, eternal life has arrived.The saki without hue and bragging has poured out wine un-stinted; the mountain of Qaf danced like a camel; joy extendedhas arrived.The Solomon of the spirit has again cried, “Welcome to themorning cup!” The pavilion smoothed has arrived to dazzleBilqls.Despite the envious ones of religion, in defiance of the ac-cursed devil, the salve of heart and eye has arrived in the oph-thalmic eye .For the sake of the uninitiated I have clapped a lock on mymouth; minstrel, arise and cry, “Eternal delight has arrived.”A litde fox carried off the sheep’s tail; was the lion perchanceasleep? The blind and blue fox does not carry off its own lifefrom the lion.The lion purposely gave way, otherwise who would believethis, that the lame fox stole the sheep’s tail from the lion?He says, “A wolf ate Joseph son of Jacob”; even the lion ofthe skies cannot loose its talons on him.Every moment the inspiration of God is guarding our hearts;how should the envious devil snatch our felicity from us?God’s hand is outstretched; do not seek to cheat God’shand; whoever sows a grain in God’s path reaps barleycorn bybarleycorn.Whoever humiliates you, go, commit him to God; whoeverseeks to dismay you, quickly turn your face to God.Agony and fear and suffering are God’s lasso; pain brings youpulling at your ear to the portal of bounty.  “Lord, Lord!” exclaiming, face to heaven turning, tears fromyour eyes running over your pale cheeks like a river —Green herbage sprung from the water over your desolateheart and soul, dawn stripping off the veil — That is the Day ofEternity.If Pharaoh’s head had ached with pain and tribulation, howwould that rebel have uttered the boast of divinity?When the moment of drowning arrived he cried, “I amthe least of slaves”; unbelief became faith, and he saw, whencalamity showed its face.Withhold not suffering from your body; plunge it into thecurrent of the Nile, so that your Pharaoh-like body may be pu-rified of stubborn denial.The carnal soul is prince in Egypt, it is a prisoner in the cur-rent of the Nile; be like Gabriel over it, bring smoke out of thealoes-wood.It is a miserly aloes-wood, it will not convey scent to you norunlock its secret until it endures fire and smoke.The Pride of Tabriz, Shams-i Haqq u Din whispered, “Loveis sour-faced with you: it is not fitting to add more vinegar.”The month of fasting has come, the emperor’s banner hasarrived; withhold your hand from food, the spirit’s table hasarrived.The soul has escaped from separation and bound nature’shands; the heart of error is defeated, the army of faith hasarrived.The army of the snorting chargers has put its hand to plun-der, from the fire of the strikers of fire the soul is brought tolamentation.The Cow was goodly, Moses son of ‘Imran appeared;through him the dead became living when it was sacrificed.  Fasting is as our sacrifice, it is the life of our soul; let us sacri-fice all our body, since the soul has arrived as guest.Fortitude is as a sweet cloud, wisdom rains from it, because itwas in such a month of fortitude that the Koran arrived.When the carnal soul is in need, the spirit goes into Ascen-sion; when the gate of the prison is broken, the soul reaches theBeloved.The heart has rent the curtain of darkness and winged upto the sky; the heart, being of the angels, has again arrived atthem.Quickly clutch the rope out of this body’s well; at the top ofthe well of water cry, “Joseph of Canaan has arrived.”When Jesus escaped from the ass his prayers became ac-cepted; wash your hands, for the Table has arrived from heaven.Wash your hands and your mouth, neither eat nor speak;seek that speech and that morsel which has come to the silentones.Flold on the skirt of Flis grace, for suddenly Fie will flee; butdo not draw Him as an arrow, for He will flee from the bow.What images does He play at, what tricks contrive! If He ispresent in form, He will flee by the way of spirit.Seek Him in the sky, and He shines from the water like themoon; enter the water, and He flees up to heaven.Call Him from the placeless and He points you to place; seekHim in place and He flees to the placeless.Is not the bird of your imagination fleet as an arrow in ex-istence? Know that for a certainty the Absolute flees from theimaginary.I will flee from this and that out of fear (not out of weari-ness) because my gracious Beauty flees from this and that.Fleet of foot as the wind am I for love of the Rose, not therose that for fear of the autumn wind flees from the garden.  When it sees an attempt at speaking, His name flees so thatyou cannot say, “So-and-so will flee.”He will flee from you so that if you draw His image, theimage will fly from the tablet, the expression will flee from theheart.ii What king is He who fashions a king out of dust, for the sakeof one or two beggars makes Himself a beggar!He acts the mendicant like the poor and wretched with HisGive God a loan, that He may give you a kingdom and fashion athrone.He passes by the dead and bestows life on the dead, Helooks upon pain and contrives a cure for the pain.When He congeals the wind He makes of the wind water,when He causes the water to boil He fashions out of it air.Look not meanly on the world, for that the world is perish-ing, tor afterwards He will fashion it into an eternal world.Men marvel at the alchemy which converts copper into gold;regard the copper that every instant fashions alchemy!If there are a thousand locks on your heart, do not fear; seekthe shop of love which the Sweetheart fashions.He who, without pen and implement, in the idol-house fash-ions for us a thousand beauteous forms,Has fashioned for us a thousand Lailas and Majnuns — whatform is it that God fashions tor the sake of God!If your heart is of iron, weep not tor its hardness, for the pol-ishing of His bounty is making it into a mirror of purity.When you cut away from your friends and go beneaththe dust, He will make of snakes and ants fair-featuredcompanions.Did not Moses fashion the serpent into a succour and a sup-port? Does not He every moment fashion fidelity out of verycruelty?  Look this instant into the grave of your body, what heart-ravishing phantasms He momently fashions there!When you cleave open your breast, then you see nothing —lest any man should prate idly, saying, “Where does He fashionthem?”The proverb says, “Eat the grapes and enquire not of thegarden”; God fashions out of stone two hundred fountains ofcontentment.Look inside the stone, and there is no trace of the water; it isfrom the Unseen that He fashions, not out of low and high.Out of the unconditioned came this conditioned, for out ofNo He fashions a myriad sayers of Yes.Behold two rivers of light flowing from two pieces of fat;marvel not that He fashions a stave into a serpent.Examine these two ears; where is the amber of speech? Mar-vel at Him who makes of a hole amber!He gives the house a soul and makes it a master; when Heslays the master, He fashions of him again a house;Though the form of the master has descended under thedust, He fashions the heart of the master into an abode ofmajesty.To the eye of men who worship form, the master departed,but He is fashioning the master a cloak of a different design.Be silent, speak less with the tongue of praise and paean, thatGod may fashion you into paean and praise.On the day of death, when my bier is on the move, do notsuppose that I have any pain at leaving this world.Do not weep for me, say not “Alas, alas!” You will fall intothe devil’s snare — that would indeed be alas!When you see my hearse, say not “Parting, parting!” Thattime there will be for me union and encounter.  When you commit me to the grave, say not “Farewell,farewell!” For the grave is a veil over the reunion of paradise. Having seen the going-down, look upon the coming-up;how should setting impair the sun and the moon?To you it appears as setting, but it is a rising; the tomb ap-pears as a prison, but it is release for the soul.What seed ever went down into the earth which did notgrow? Why do you doubt so regarding the human seed?What bucket ever went down and came not out full? Whythis complaining of the well by the Joseph of the spirit?When you have closed your mouth on this side, open it onthat, for your shout of triumph will echo in the placeless air.Love took away sleep from me — and love takes away sleep,for love purchases not the soul and mind for so much as half abarleycorn.Love is a black lion, thirsty and blood-drinking, it pasturesonly on the blood oflovers.It clings to you in affection, and drags you to the snare;when you have fallen in, then it looks on from afar.Love is a tyrannous prince, an unscrupulous police officer, ittortures and strangles the innocent. Whoso falls into Love’s hands weeps like a cloud; whosodwells afar from Love freezes like snow.Every instant Love shatters a thousand bowls into fragments,every moment stitches and rends a thousand garments.Love causes a thousand eyes to weep, and goes on laughing;Love slays miserably a thousand souls, and counts them as one.Though the simurgh flies happily in Mount Qaf, when it seesLove’s snare it falls, and flies no more.No man escapes from Love’s cords by deceit or madness, noreasoning man escapes from its snare by intelligence.  io My words are disordered because of Love, else I would haveshown you the ways Love travels;I would have shown you how Love seizes the lion, I wouldhave shown you how Love hunts the prey.Henceforward the nightingale in the garden will tell of us, itwill tell of the beauty of that heart-ravishing Beloved.When the wind falls upon the head of the willow and it be-gins to dance, God alone knows what things it says to the air.The plane-tree understands a litde about the meadow’sburning, it lifts up two broad hands sweetly and prays.I ask the rose, “From whom did you steal that beauty?” Therose laughs softly out of shame, but how should she tell? Though the rose is drunk, it is not dissolute like me, that itshould tell you the secret of the intoxicated narcissus.When you seek secrets, go amongst the drunkards, for thetipsy head shamelessly tells the secret.Inasmuch as wine is the daughter of the vine and the familyof generosity, it has opened the purse’s mouth and speaks oflavishness;Especially the wine of the heavenly trellis from the All-generous Almighty; haply God will speak of its lavishness andgenerosity.That new wine ferments from the breast of the gnostic, outof the depths of his body’s vat it invites you to the feast,io Since the breast gives milk, it can also give wine; from thebreast its flowing fountain tells a pretty tale.When that spirit becomes more intoxicated, it stakes itscloak, lays down cap, and abandons this gown.When the reason drinks blood-red wine recklessly, it opensits mouth and tells the mysteries of Majesty.Be silent, for no one will believe you; bad copper swallowsnot what the philosopher’s stone says.  Bear tidings to Tabriz, Pride of the World; perchance ourShams-i Din will speak your praise.Love tor you makes me oblivious to my own kindred, forlove of you has rooted up the foundations of well-being;For Love desires only ruination of one’s affairs, for Love ac-cepts counsel from no calamity.What place is there for wealth and fair repute and respect andpomp? What is household and safety, what family or children?When Love’s sword snatches away the lover’s soul, a thou-sand lay down their sacred lives in thanks therefor.What, the desire oflove for you, and then the fear of ruina-tion? You with purse fastened, and then the love for that sugarlip?Draw back your head and sit in the corner of safety — theshort hand aspires not to the tall cypress.Go! In all your life you have not caught the scent of Love;this is not Love, this is reason self-satisfied.What is it to exercise patience and snatch the skirt out oftemptation, seated to see what will come down from heaven fora few days?Love’s fire arrived and consumed all that is beside Him; sinceall is consumed, sit content and laugh gaily!Especially the love of that One the like of whom, from Alasttill now, has never been so devoted to chastity.If you say, “I have seen Him,” for God’s sake open anothereye and close these twain;For by this glance, thousands of thousands like me and youin both worlds have been destroyed and blinded for ever.If to my eye other than that Beauty should come, may mytwo eyes be gouged out with an axe!The sight of all heroic men has proved powerless; howshould the slothful attain the Beauty and Majesty of the King?  Would that God had rent the veil of being, even as ‘All theLion rent the gates of Khaibar,That the eye might have seen how for a thousand years, fivetimes a day, the drums are beaten tor him on the other side!Love tor you took away my rosary and gave verses and songs;I cried “No strength (save with God)” and repented oft, but myheart did not heed.At Love’s hand I became a singer of odes, hand-clapping;love for you consumed reputation and shame and all that I pos-sessed.Once I was chaste and self-denying and firm-footed as amountain; what mountain is there that your wind did not carryaway like chaff?If I am a mountain, yet I hold the echo of your voice; and if Iam chaff, in your fire I am reduced to smoke . When I saw your being, I became nonexistent out of shame;out of the love of this nonexistence the world of soul came intobeing.Wherever nonexistence comes, existence diminishes — bravenonexistence, from which, when it came, existence augmented!Heaven is blue, earth like a blind squatter on the road; hewho beholds your moon escapes from blind -and -blue.The likeness of the soul of a great saint hidden in the bodyof the world is the likeness of Ahmad the Messenger amidst theGuebres and Jews.To praise you in reality is to praise oneself, for he who praisesthe sun thereby praises his own eyes,io Your praise is as the sea, our tongue is a ship; the soul voy-ages on the sea, and its end is praiseworthy.The tender care of the sea is for me like wakeful fortune; whyshould I grieve, if my eye is stained with sleep?  At the night prayer, when the sun declines to sinking, thisway of the senses is closed and the way to the Unseen is opened.The angel of sleep then drives forward the spirits, even as theshepherd who watches over his flock.To the placeless, towards the spiritual meadows, what citiesand what gardens he there displays to them!The spirit beholds a thousand marvellous forms and shapes,when sleep excises from it the image of the world. You might say that the spirit was always a dweller there, itremembers not this world, and its weariness does not increase.Its heart so escapes from the load and burden for which ittrembled here, that no care for it gnaws at it any more.A little apple, half red and half yellow, made tale of rose andsaffron.When the lover became parted from the beloved, thebeloved carried off the airs of pride, the lover the pains.These two contrary hues through a single separation havedisplayed {love} on the cheeks of both.It is not appropriate for the beloved’s cheeks to be yellow;for the lover to be red and fat is unseemly. Since the beloved has begun to show airs, endure his airs,lover, and do not battle against them.I am like a thorn and my master is as the rose; they are twain,in reality they are one.He is as the sun, and I am the shadow; his is the heat of con-tinuance, mine the cold.Goliath went out against Toliath; David measured well thelinks.  The heart was bom of the body but is the king of the body,even as man is bom of woman.Again within the heart there is a heart hidden, like a horse-man hidden in dust;The stirring of the dust is caused by the horseman — it is hewho caused this dust to dance.No chess is it, tor you to apply your thoughts; with trust inGod fling away your counter like dice.Shams-i Tabriz is the sun of the heart; that heat nurtured thefruits of the heart.My verse resembles the bread of Egypt — night passes over it,and you cannot eat it any more.Devour it the moment it is fresh, before the dust settlesupon it.Its place is the warm climate of the heart; in this world it diesof cold.Like a fish it quivered for an instant on dry land, anothermoment and you see it is cold.Even if you eat it imagining it is fresh, it is necessary to con-jure up many images.What you drink is really your own imagination; it is no oldtale, my good man.Take heed, for the time of men of fortitude has come, thehour of hardship and testing has come.In such a time covenants are broken, when the knife reachesto the bone.Covenants and oaths become very weak when the affairs of aman threaten his life.  Ha, my heart, do not make yourself weak; make your heartstrong, for the time for that has come. Laugh like red gold in the fire, that men may say, “The goldof the mine has come.”Eager and cheerful before the sword of doom, cry aloud,“The champion has come.”Be with God and pray to Him for help, for replenishmenthas come from heaven. God, shake the sleeve of bounty, since Your servant hascome to the threshold.Like an oyster shell we have our mouths open, for the cloudof Your pearl-scattering grace has come.io Many a dry thorn there is out of whose heart a rosegardenhas emerged in Your protection. have pointed to You, because from You signless joys havecome.It is the time of compassion and sympathy, for a very heavyblow has come upon me.Ababil! Take heed, for the army of the Elephant withoutbounds has come against the Kaaba.Reason says to me, “Be silent! Enough; for God who knowsthe Unseen has come.” I held my peace, O God; but without my will lamentationmounted up from my soul.Thou threwest not when thou threwest is also of God — thearrow which suddenly came from this bow.Someone said, “Master Sana’! is dead.” The death of such amaster is no small thing.He was not chaff which flew on the wind, he was not waterwhich froze in the cold;He was not a comb that split on a hair, he was not a seedcrushed by the earth.  He was a treasure of gold in this dust bowl, tor he reckonedboth worlds at one barleycorn.The earthly mould he flung to the earth, the soul of reasonhe carried to the heavens.The second soul of which men know nothing — we talkambiguously — he committed to the Beloved.The pure wine mingled with the wine-dregs, rose to the topof the vat and separated from the dregs.They meet together on the journey, dear friend, native ofMarghaz, of Rayy, of Rum, Kurd;Each one returns to his own home — how should silk becompared with striped cloth?Be silent, like (a letter’s) points, inasmuch as the King haserased your name from the volume of speech.Ah, what was there in that light- giving candle that it set fireto the heart, and snatched the heart away?You who have set fire to my heart, I am consumed, O friend;come quickly, quickly!The form of the heart is not a created form, for the beauty ofGod manifested itself from the cheek of the heart.I have no succour save in his sugar, I have no profit save inhis lip.Remember him who one dawn released this heart of minefrom the chain of your tress.My soul, the first time I saw you my soul heard somethingfrom your soul.When my heart drank water from your fountain it drownedin you, and the torrent snatched me away. + A sour-faced one has come — perchance is he the bitter win-ter cold? Pour a winecup over his head, saki, sweet as sugar.Either give him wine from the bottle, or send him on hisway now, for it is not pleasant, boy, tor an efreet to be amongstrose-cheelced beauties.Bestow the prophetic wine, so that the ass may not continuein assishness; from Jesus’ wine two wings forthwith sprout onthe ass.If a sober heart enters the assembly of the drunkards, do notlet him; you know that, in the state of drunkenness, good andevil befall the drunkard. Watchman, sit by the door, give not admittance to our as-sembly save to the heart-aflame lover from whom comes theodour of a burning heart.If you want a hand, he gives a foot; if you want a foot, he laysdown his head; if you want to borrow a hoe, instead of the hoehe brings an axe.Since I became immersed in wine I have become withoutshame and heart; the shield is no protection to me, I am myselfas a shield before the sword.I desire a chanter, a living water of life, to set fire to sleep andto utter this melody till dawn.If you find one sober vein in me, pluck it out; if a manhas not been a lion catcher of God, reckon him a dog in thispath.io Some folk dissolute and drunk and gay, some folk slaves tothe five and the six; these are apart and those are apart, these areother and those are other.I have consumed beyond measure, for I have lost the trea-sure; bind my hand, bind my mouth — this is how to preservethe drunkard.Take heed, convert our sting to honey, give ear to ourlament; make us senseless like yourself, senseless look upon us.  Yesterday at dawn passing by the Beloved said to me, “Youare distraught and unaware; how long will this go on?My cheek is the envy of the rose; and have you filled your eyewith heart’s blood in quest of the thorn?”I said, “Before your stature the cypress is but a sapling! ” Isaid, “Before your cheek the heavens’ candle is dark!”I said, “Sky and earth are topsy-turvy on account of you; it isno wonder therefore, if I have no access to you.” He said, “I am your soul and heart; why are you dis-tracted? Say no word, and remain weeping against my silverybosom.”I said, “You who have robbed my heart and soul of repose, Ihave not the power to be still.” He said at once,“You are a drop of my sea; why do you utter still? Becomedrowned, and fill the soul of the oyster shell with pearls.”Again in sleep that root of wakefulness gave me the opium ofwild commotion and set me reeling.With a hundred devices I try to be heedless, I make myself toignore him; that perfect moon comes, holding in his hand sucha bowl.He says to me, “Will you not say how long with those beg-garly looks, like every naked unfortunate, you will go on beg-ging at every door?With this complaining and reviling you are the slave ofdervish habit and ewer; if you are true and a man of verity, whyare you in this sack? Kings are put to shame by these things which are born ofyou; you were an angel — why must you be the plaything of thedevil?”  Who knows to speak what he speaks? For the world is not hismate; the universe is blind, and being deaf, to what he disclosesand conceals.If I had the tongue to reveal the Beloved’s secret, every soulwhich heard would burst out of this pass.On account of that sea- bountiful Beloved my state is verydifficult, lor my breast is laid waste by that leaping and chargingto and fro.If I tell the believers they will all instantly become infidels,and if I tell the infidels no infidel will remain in the world.When last night his phantom came in sleep, graciously it en-quired of me, “How are you?” I said, “Without you, in direstraits.”If I had a hundred souls, they would all become blood shedin grieving tor you, Beloved; your heart is stone, {granite,} or amountain of marble!I grant that your prince has gold by the ton; but how hap-pens it that the gold-rich man obtains a cheek like gold?When they heard complaining from the wretched, frenziedlover, rose and rose bower came out from the earth to beholdthe spectacle .Quick, strip off your clothes at once; jump into this pool,that you may escape from your head and the pressure of yourturban.We too like you used to disapprove of this tumult; through asingle wink we became thus beguiled by the beloved.How long will you break your lover out of jealous rage? Letbe, that this sick heart may utter two or three laments.No, no, let it not be, tor by reason of its wretched lamenta-tion neither earth’s people remains, nor the wheeling sky.Today it were no wonder if that veiled world were not dis-closed by leave of the Veiler.  Again this mad heart has broken loose from its chain, torn itscollar once more out of passionate love.Silence! For the indication from the King of Love is thus: “Infortitude seize and compress the throat of your heart and soul! ”In this cold and rain the Beloved is sweeter, the Beauty in thebosom, and Love in the brain.The Beauty in the bosom, and what a beauty! Graceful andfair and supple and fresh and shining-new.In this cold let us flee to his quarter, for none his like wasever born of mother.In this snow let us kiss his lips, for snow and sugar refresh theheart. I have no more strength, I am gone out of hand, they havecarried me away and brought me again.When his phantasm suddenly enters the heart, the heart de-parts out of its place; God is Most Great!There is a light in the midst of the red hair, transcending eyeand imagination and spirit.Do you desire to stitch yourself to it? Arise, and rend the veilof the carnal soul.That subtle spirit became a form with eyebrows and eyes andbrown skin.God the Inscrutable disclosed Himself to the form of theChosen Prophet. That form of his passed away in the Form, and that eye ofhis, like the day of resurrection.Every time he looked upon men, a hundred doors wereopened by God.  When the form of the Chosen One passed away, “God isMost Great” seized the world.I have a bad habit; I am weary; pray excuse me. How shallmy habit become seemly without your fair face, my beauty?Without you I am like winter, people are tormented becauseof me; with you I am as a rose bower, my habit is the habit ofspring.Without you I lack reason, I am weary, everything I say iscrooked, I am ashamed of reason and reason is shamefast at thelight of your face.What is the remedy tor bad water? To return to the river.What is the remedy for bad habits? To see the beloved’s laceagain.I see the water of the soul imprisoned in this whirlpool of thebody; I dig out the earth to make a way to the sea.You have a potion which you give the despairing, secretly,lest the hopeful, grieving for it, should utter lamentation.O heart, so much as you are able do not withhold your eyefrom the Beloved, whether He withdraws from you or drawsyou into His bosom.Each moment I catch from my bosom the scent of the Beloved;how should I not take my self every night into my bosom?Last night I was in Love’s garden; that desire ran into myhead; his sun peeped out of my eye, so that the river began toflow.Every laughing rose that springs from the bank of thatriver oflove had escaped from the thorn of being and eludedDhu ’-Eaqar;  Every tree and grass was a-dancing in the meadow, but in theeye of the vulgar was bound and at rest.Suddenly from one side our Cypress appeared, so that thegarden was beside itself and the plane-tree clapped its hands.Face like fire, wine like fire, love afire — all three delightful;soul because of the intermingled fires lamenting, “Whither shallI flee?”In the world of Divine Unity there is no room for number,but number exists of necessity in the world of five and four.You may count a myriad sweet apples in your hand; if youwant to make one, squeeze them all together.A myriad grapes went forth from the veil of skin; when skinno more remained, there remained the wine of the Prince.Without counting the letters, behold what is this speech ofthe heart; unicolority — is it not a form derived from the root ofthe affair?Shams-i TabrizI is seated like a king, and before him myverses are ranged like willing slaves.Reason is the chain of travellers and lovers, my son; break thechain, and the way is plain and clear ahead, my son.Reason is a chain, heart a cheat, body a delusion, soul a veil;the way is hidden from all these heavinesses, my son.When you have risen out of reason, soul, and heart, and youhave gone forth, still this certainty and this direct vision is indoubt, my son.The man who has not departed out of self is not a man, myson; the love which is not of the soul is but a legend, my son.Set up your breast as a target before the arrow of His decree;be sharp, for the arrow of His decree is already in the bow, my son.The breast that has been wounded by the striking of the arrowof His tug, on its brow and face are a hundred marks, my son.  If you mount like Idris to the seventh heaven, the love of theBeloved is an excellent ladder indeed, my son.On every side where a caravan takes its proud way beholdlove, which is the qiblci of the caravan, my son.His love has cast a shadow on the earth like a snare; Hishuntsmanlike love is in heaven, my son.Enquire not of me concerning love, enquire not of any man,enquire of Love itself; Love in speaking is like a pearl-rainingcloud, my son.Love requires not the interpreter service of me and a hun-dred like me; concerning realities Love is its own interpreter,my son.Love is not the business of those asleep or soft and delicate,Love is the business of the brave and of heroes, my son.Whoso has become the servant of lovers and true ones, he isa king, an emperor, a master of fortune, my son.Let not this world full of magic spells lure you away fromLove, lor this faithless world is leaping away from you, my son.If the verses of this ode have become long in its joins, thetune has changed but the meaning is the same, my son.Take heed, close your mouth and be silent henceforth like anoyster shell, for this tongue of yours is in reality the enemy ofthe soul, my son.Tonight is a night of union for the stars and of scattering,scattering, since a bride is coming from the skies, consisting of afull moon.Venus cannot contain herself tor charming melodies, like thenightingale which becomes intoxicated with the rose in spring-time.See how the Polestar is ogling Leo; behold what dust Piscesis stirring up from the deep!  Jupiter has galloped his steed against ancient Saturn, saying,“Take back your youth and go, bring good tidings!”Mars’ hand, which was full of blood from the handle of hissword, has become life-giving as the sun, the exalted in works.Since Aquarius has come full of that water of life, the drycluster of Virgo is raining pearls from him.The Pleiades (nut) full of goodness fears not Libra and be-ing broken; how should Aries flee away in fright from itsmother?When from the moon the arrow of a glance struck the heartof Sagittarius, he took to night-faring in passion for her, likeScorpio.On such a festival, go, sacrifice Taurus, else you are crookedof gait in the mud like Cancer.This sky is the astrolabe, and the reality is Love; whatever wesay of this, attend to the meaning.Shams-i Tabriz, on that dawn when you shine, the darknight is transformed to bright day by your moonlike face.That beauty handed me a broom saying, “Stir up the dustfrom the sea!”He then burned the broom in the fire saying, “Bring up thebroom out of the fire!”In bewilderment I made prostration before him; he said,“Without a prostrator, offer a graceful prostration!”“Ah, how prostrate without a prostrator?” He said, “Uncon-ditionally, without personal impulse.”I lowered my neck and said, “Cut off' the head of a prostratorwith Dhu TFaqar.”The more he struck with the sword, the more my head grew,till heads a myriad sprouted from my neck;I was a lamp, and every head of mine was as a wick; sparksflew on every side.  Candles sprang up out of my heads, east to west was filledwith the train.What are east and west in the placeless? A dark bath-stove,and a bath at work.io You whose temperament is cold, where is the anxiety of yourheart? How long this dwelling at rest in these baths?Go forth from the baths and enter not the stove; strip your-self, and look upon those paintings and figures,Until you behold the ravishing figures, until you behold thehues of the tulip -bed.When you have beheld, look towards the window, tor thatbeauty became a beauty through the reflection of the window.The six directions are the bath, and the window is the place-less; above the window is the beauty of the Prince. Earth and water acquired colour from his reflection, soulrained on Turk and Zanzibari.The day is gone, and my story has not grown short — O nightand day put to shame by his tale !King Shams al-Din-i Tabriz! keeps me intoxicated, crop-sickness upon crop-sickness.I went there intoxicated and said, “O beauty, when you havemaddened me, give ear!”He replied, “See, in my ear is a ring; become fastened to thatring like a pendant.”I quickly reached out to touch his ring; he struck me saying,“Hold back your hand from me!You will find the way into this ring only when you become aroyal pearl in purity. My golden ring, and then a bead! How should Jesus go upto heaven on an ass?”  Joyous spring has arrived and the Beloved’s message hascome; we are drunk with love and intoxicated and cannot bestill.O my darling one, go forth to the garden, do not leave thebeauties of the meadow in expectation.Strangers from the Unseen have arrived in the meadow; goforth, for it is a rule that “the newcomer is visited.”Following your footsteps the rose has come into the rose-bower, to greet and meet you the thorn has become soft ofcheek.Cypress, give ear, for the lily in exposition of you has becomeall tongue by the bank of the river.The bud was tightly knotted; your grace looses knots; therose blossoms thanks to you, and scatters its petals over you.You might say that it is the resurrection, that there haveraised their heads from the earth those who rotted in Decem-ber and January, the dead of yesteryear.The seed which had died has now found life, the secretwhich earth held has now become revealed.The bough which held fruit is glorying for joy, the rootwhich had none is shamefast and ashamed.After all, the trees of the spirit will become even so, the treeof excellent boughs and fortunate will be manifest.The king of spring has drawn up his army and made his pro-visions; the jasmine has seized the shield, the green grass DhuTFaqar.They say, “We will cut off the head of So-and-so like chives;behold that visibly enacted in the handiwork of the Creator. ”Yes; when the succour of divine assistance arrives, Nimrod isbrought to destruction by a gnat.  Do not slacken the bowstring, for I am your four-featheredarrow; do not turn your face away, for I am a man with oneheart, not two-headed.From you is the striking of the sharp sword, from the heartand soul a hundred consents; I am a man of one word like fate,I am not “if” or “perhaps”!If you draw Dhu ’-Faqar I am constant and firm of foot, Ido not flee like the wind, I do not die like a spark.I will surrender my soul to the sword, I will not say alas; Godhas made me like a shield for the blows of His sword. Sun, smite with your glow the neck of the night as with asword; whence comes the darkness of the nights? From theforge of muddy earth.The body is a mine of endurance, the heart is a mine of grat-itude, the bosom is a mine of laughter, the liver is a mine ofcompassion.Make your throne, O king, on my head as a cap; tightly drawme into your breast as a garment.Someone said, “Whence has Love form and hands?” Love isthe sprouting-bed of every hand and foot in the forms.Did not your father and mother play at love for one mo-ment? When they were united, one like you made his appear-ance.io Do not regard Love, which without hands made yourhand a hand, as being without hand or head; look in anotherfashion.You who have eyes to see, the colour of all faces, the waterof all rivers — know these are Shams-i Haqq, the Pride ofTabriz.  He said, “My sugar-sweet lip is worth a treasure of pearls.”“Ah, I have no pearls.” He said, “You have not? Then buy!Make a snare for me out of pearls, and if that does not suc-ceed, then borrow. You have mistaken the house, you loverwithout silver and gold!You have come to a gambling-match; bring a purse full ofgold. Else, leave us and be gone, do not vex and trouble us more.We are highwaymen, we are renders of garments; if you areone of us, come in, drink and drink deep! We tear to shreds all snares, we devour all properties; we aresweeter than all others — despite all the blind and deaf.”Those who buy garments are different from those who rendthem; those who rend garments pluck out the mustachios ofevery garment-buyer.The Moses of the soul plucked out the mustachios of thePharaoh of the body, so that the body becomes all soul, everyhair-tip alive.Recognize the travellers on the path of his love by their pal-lid cheeks; know that the pearls oflove are tears, love’s silk theheart’s blood.What is the worth of the gold-pale cheek? Say: the ruby ofthe Beloved. What is the worth of the pearl-like tear? Say: thatglance.io We are slaves to that saki, till eternity we continue; our worldis secure and content, the worldlings are passing by.Whoever has been born has died and committed his soul tothe guardian angel; the lover was born of no man, love has nofather.If you are not of this face, then sit behind like the nape; ifyou are not the nape, then advance like a shield.Advance like a shield unconscious, and behold how the con-scious ones are struck unconscious by the glance of the Friend’sblow.  God has written around the cheek of the Beloved the inscrip-tion Therefore take heed of him, you who have eyes.Since Love devours men, it is necessary for a man to makehimself a morsel before man-devouring Love.You are a sour morsel, and are very long digesting; the saintis a sweet morsel easy to digest.Do you break the morsel you are, because that mouth is narrow;even three elephants would not devour you, save at three gulps.In face of your greed the elephant itself is a morsel; you arelike the ababll birds which made the elephant their prey.You were born of non-entity, come after a long famine; toyou, fattened bird as food and serpent and snake are the same .You have come to a hot cauldron; now you burn yourmouth, now you blacken your clothes and lips and turban.With nothing are you sated, like the belly of hell, save per-chance the Almighty Creator sets His loot on you,Even as He sets His foot on the head of hell, and hell pro-claims, “Enough, I am full, lift up Your loot!”God satiates the eye of the saints and the elect, lor they aredelivered from self and from greed lor this carrion.No greed remains in them tor knowledge and science, nodesire tor paradise; the lion-rider does not seek for ass or camel.Silence! Were I to count His gifts and donations, resurrec-tion day itself would become giddy and confounded at the tally.Come, Pride of Tabriz, true Shams al-DTn; the sun in thespinning skies is your humble slave.Look not for happiness when the Beauty’s inclination is seton sorrow, for you are prey in the clutches of a lion, my dearfriend.  Though the Beloved sprinkles plaster on your head, welcomethat as if it was Tartary musk.Since within you lurks a hidden enemy, there is no repellingthat monster save by harshness.The man who beats a stick on a rug, it is not aimed at therug, but the whole purpose is to rid the rug of dust. Layers of dust are within you, consisting of the veil of ego-ism; that dust is not got rid of at a single blow;With each harshness and each blow, little by litrie that is dis-persed from the cheek of the heart, now sleeping, now awake.If you take flight in sleep, in dreams you will see the crueltyof the Beloved and the execrations of that Benefactor.Scraping a stick is not in order to destroy the stick, it is for agood purpose in the heart of the carpenter.For this reason every evil on God’s path is good, for that Hewill show man pure and refined at the end of the affair,io Consider the hide which the tanner rubs in all manner offilth a thousand times over,So that the inward flaw may go forth from the hide, eventhough the hide knows naught oflittle or much.Sun and Pride of Tabriz, you possess great virtues; makehaste, for you have a mighty power in the secrets.If a tree could move on foot or wing, it would not suffer thepain of the saw or the blows of the axe;And if the sun did not travel on wing and foot all the night,how would the world be illumined at morningtide?If the salt water did not rise from the sea to the sky, whencewould the garden be revived by torrent and rain?When the drop departed from its homeland and returned, itencountered a shell and became a pearl. Did not Joseph go from his father on a journey, weeping? Didhe not on the journey attain felicity and kingdom and victory?  Did not Mustafa go on a journey towards Yathrib, gainsovereignty, and become king of a hundred lands?And you — if you have no foot, choose to journey into your-self; like a ruby-mine be receptive to a print from the sunbeams.Make a journey out of self into self, my master, tor by such ajourney earth became a mine of gold.Go out of sourness and bitterness towards sweetness, just asa thousand sorts of fruits have escaped out of bitterness.Seek sweetness from the Sun, the Pride of Tabriz, for everyfruit gains comeliness from the light of the sun.Look on me, for I shall be your companion in the grave onthat night when you pass across from shop and house .You will hear my greeting in the tomb, and you will be awarethat not tor a moment you have been veiled from my eyes.I am like reason and mind within your veil, alike in time ofpleasure and happiness and in the hour of pain and weariness.On the strange night, when you hear the voice familiar, youwill escape from the bite of snake and leap away from the horrorof ant;Love’s intoxication will bring to your grave, as a gift, wineand mistress and candle and meats and sweets and incense.On the hour when we light the lamp of the intellect, what atumult of joy shall go up from the dead in the tombs!The dust of the graveyard will be confounded by those cries,by the din of the drum of resurrection, the pomp and panoplyof the uprising —Shrouds rent asunder, two ears stopped up in terror; whatshall avail brain and ear before the blast of the trumpet?On whatever side you gaze, you will behold my form, whetheryou gaze on yourself or towards that uproar and confusion.Flee from squinteyedness, and make good both your eyes,for the evil eye on that day will be far from my beauty.  Beware of mistaking me in a human shape, tor the spirit isvery subtle, and Love is exceedingly jealous.What room is there for form, if the felt be a hundredfold? Itis the rays of the soul’s mirror that pitch the flag visibly.Beat the drum, and wind towards the minstrels of the city; itis the day of purification to the grown lads of the road of Love.Had they sought God, instead of morsel and pence, youwould not have seen one blind man seated on the edge of themoat. What sort of ogling-house have you opened in our city!Mouth shut, shoot out glances, like light.My bowl has broken, and no wine has remained to me, andI am crop-siclc; let Shams-e Din set in order my disorderedestate —Prince of the world of vision, lamp of the world of revelation,to whom the spirits make heartfelt obeisance from afar,That his hand may bring out of the sea of bewilderment athousand souls and spirits drowned and utterly whelmed.If heaven and earth were filled with the darkness of unbelief,when he shines, his rays flood all that with light. That pure radiance which the angels discover from him — if itshould reach the satans, they would all become houris.And even if that light belonged not for a single day to thedevil, he would veil the devil with the veils of his bountifulness.On the day of festival, when he begins to dispense, on everyside is a marriage feast, in every quarter a wedding party.From the direction of Tabriz that sun shines — the atomscome to life as at the blast of the trumpet.Zephyr, for God’s sake and by the right of bread andsalt — for every dawn I and you have been rejoiced by him — When you come to the end of the frontiers of the unseenworld, pass over them, and be not lazy as one sick and suffering.On that wing which you have gotten from him fly; tor athousand years’ journey will not be far from your wing.Fly; and when your wing becomes weary, prostrate your-self for the sake of my state, weary of soul and sundered ofheart;Tell him with tears that since the time of our separation, myday has become black and my hairs camphor-white.You are he who dips in the sea of compassion all the sinnersof the world, and makes them forgiven.If the seeing eye cannot penetrate to your soul, he who hasno eye may truly be excused.So contrive by entreaty as to bring the dust of his feet to theeye, for this sickness is becoming gangrenous.And when, zephyr, you return prospering from this journey,you will stir up commotion and sparks indeed in existence andnonexistence alike.When you bring me his eye salve, may a thousand new com-passions be upon your soul for centuries beyond reckoning!Minstrel of the lovers, shake the string, strike fire into be-liever and infidel!Silence is not the proper course oflove; unveil the face ofwelfare.Until the infant in the cradle weeps, how shall the anxiousmother give it milk?Whatever is other than the phantom of the Beloved is thethorn of Love, even if it be a rosebower.Minstrel, when you have reached to dilate my heart, have acare; you have set your foot in blood —Set your foot slowly, lest a drop of the heart’s blood splashout on the wall.Minstrel, observe well the wounds of the heart; so long asthey are not conscious of their pain, be at ease.  Minstrel, mention the name of the beloved who has robbedour heart of fortitude and quietude.What have I said? Where has a heart remained still? If myheart were a mountain, it had gone out of control.Speak his name, and name me less, that I may nickname you“Excellent of speech.”When I speak of how he moves, where does my heart go?Brave movement indeed!Shams-i Tabriz, you are the Jesus of the age; in your agethere is such a sick one.Who has compassion on a friend? A friend likewise. Whohears the sigh of the sick? The sick.Where are the tears of sympathetic spring, that they may fillthe thorn’s skirt with roses?Mention often the demolisher of joy; give ear to pitilessautumn.The cave becomes paradise, when he is in it: the second of Wo,when the Wo were in the Cave.Heaven splits in two at the sigh of a lover; the lamentation oflovers is not to be despised.Heaven revolves lor the sake of lovers; on account of love thesky spins around,Not for the sake of baker and smith, not for the sake of car-penter and druggist.The skies rotate about love; rise, that we may also circlearound.Consider who said, “But for thee I would not have created”;Ahmad the Chosen is the mine of love.For a while let us circle about loverhood; how long shall wecircle about this carrion?Where is the eye to behold the spirits, putting their headsout from door and wall?Door and wall tell subtleties, fire and earth and water re-hearse a tale;Like the balance, the yardstick and the touchstone they arewithout tongue, yet arbiters of the market.Lover, circle about like the sky, silent from speaking, andaltogether speech.So drunk am I, so drunk am I today that I have leaped out ofthe hoop today.Such a thing as never enters the mind, even so am I, even soam I today.In spirit I departed to the heaven of Love, even though inform I am in this low world today.I took reason by the ear and said, “Reason, go out, for I haveescaped from you today.Reason, wash your hands of me, for I am joined with themad lover today.That Joseph gave into my hand an orange; as a result, I havewounded both my hands today.”That jug full of wine has brought me to such a state that Ihave broken so many jars today.I do not know where I am, but it is a blessed station in whichI am today.Good fortune came coquettishly to my door; out of drunk-enness I closed the door to him today.When he returned, I kept running after him, I did not sitdown for a moment today.Since We are nearer has been realized, I will not worshipmyself any more today.Do not tie up that tress, Shams al-DIn-i Tabriz, for I am likea fish in this net today.  The love of that cherisher of lovers has come to his ownhouse; Love has in form-conceiving a form melting all forms.You have come to your own house; welcome, enter! Yourcoming is with joy; enter by the door of the heart, run to thevestibule of the soul.Every mote of my being is in love with your sun; take heed,for motes have long transaction with the sun.See how before the window the motes gracefully suspendedbeat; whoever has the sun for a qibla prays after this fashion. In the concert of the sun these motes are like Sufis; no oneknows to what recitation, to what rhythm, to what harmony.In every heart there is a different note and rhythm, all stamp-ing feet outwardly, and the minstrels hidden like a secret.Loftier than all is our inward concert, our particles dancingtherein with a hundred kinds of glory and pride.Shams-i Tabriz!, you are the sultan of the sultans of the soul;no Mahmud like you ever came into being, nor like me anyAyaz.Night is broad and long for the sake of lovers and thieves;ho, come, strumpet night, and do the business of both!I steal carnelians and pearls from the sultan’s treasury, I amnot mean that I should steal the draper’s cloth.Within the veil of the nights there are subtle thieves who bycunning find a way to the roof of the house of mystery.My ambition in night-faring and knavery is nothing less thanthe king’s treasury and the carnelian of that king of glory. The cheek before whose onslaught night remains no morein the world — brave lamp, which lights the sun and fashions themoon!  All the needs of men are granted on the Night of Power, forPower attained that exaltation from a full moon like you.You are all, and beyond all what else is there, that it shouldenter the imagination that anyone is your peer?Ho, pass away from this; open wide your ears, tor I am be-ginning a tale entirely rare and strange.Since you have not seen Messiah, give ear to the legend; flylike a white falcon towards the falcon-drum.Since you are a coin of red gold, receive the seal of the king;if you are not red gold, then why all this snipping?In the time when you became a treasure you did not realizethat, wherever a treasure is, the informer sets to work.Bring your treasure, and play no tricks, for you will not es-cape by vapouring and prostration and commemoration andabstinence and prayer.Do you steal, and then sit in the corner of the mosque say-ing, “I am the Junaid of the age, the Ba Yazld of supplication”?Give back the cloth, then get on with your abstinence; donot make feeble excuses and babble your tale.Hush your pretexts, for in this station men do not purchase asingle grain by dissimulation and artful trickery.Seize the skirt of felicity of Shams-i TabrlzT, that your perfec-tion may be embroidered from the magic of his sleeve.Sour-faced one, in my presence you spoke evil of me; themouth of the vulture always smells of carrion.Your filthy words became apparent in your face; vileness isever manifest in the face and complexion of the nobody.I have a Friend and Beloved, so go on grinding away atdeath and enmity; take heed, the ocean was never defiled bythe mouth of any dog.Though the Holy City has become filled with Frankish pigs,after all how has that brought the Holy Temple a bad name?  This is the face of the mirror; Joseph shines in it; the back,however that it is gilded, is a stranger.If the bat thinks evil, the sun is not grieved — how is the sunimpaired, if the shadow is upside down?Jesus was a laugher, John the Baptist a frowner; the formerlaughed out of trust, the latter frowned from fear.They said, “O Lord, which of these two is better in Youreyes? Which of these two is better in the well founded path?”God said, “He is superior who thinks better thoughts ofMe; the good thoughts of the sinner leave him not defiled.”You are a frowner not out of fear and religious aspiration,you are pale from envy or dark red from gloating.Neither of these gets anywhere, they are proper only to thefire; woe to him in whom envy is rooted!Let it go from your hand; cursed is it; whoever is enemy ofthe moon has only shadows.Know for sure, O sun, that bats are your enemies, they are adisgrace to all birds, fellow-prisoners in brooding night.The sun’s enemy is docked, that rank does not remain tohim; how long shall the mote there remain if it falls into theeye?Consorts of the Moon are your two Mars, which are thosetwo eyes of yours, Darling; with that Harut and Marut of yoursdraw the litigious ones to Babylon.Solomon, with that ring (for you are the sealing of all the fairones) by force drag in chains all the divs and peris.You have opened the treasure of beneficence for the sake ofjinns and men; draw the likeness of We have given thee over theneedy beggar.Illumine the body with the spirit, root up envy utterly; fix thegaze on the orient skies, draw the reason into problems.When the lip recites Praise, give it dessert and wine unli-  mited; when it recites Nor those astray, do you draw it intoguiding proofs.When the soul hurries towards you, give it a candle to findthe way; when it seeks your sun, draw it like the moon into the“houses.”Give the crop-sick lover the wine of Kai-Ka’us’ cup; drawbefore the thoughts of the man of reason hairsplitting andcraft.With the advancing of your favours draw the spirit and makeit receptive; draw your acceptance and investiture towards thereceptive soul.To the prisoner of pain and regret give the message of Do notdespair; draw him slain oflove for your beauty from this slaying-place to the slayer.io If this body is infidel at heart, propose “testimony” to it; andif this spirit is fruitless, what matters that? Draw it to the fruit.Quicken it, and if you cannot, make Messiah your deputy;grant it union, or if you grant it not, draw it by your grace tothe Lord of grace.Earthy one, the earth trembled when it saw that holiness andpurity; recite When it is shaken, draw the vision into trembling.Make an end of it, ho, at once, for you are the King of Stateand Word; whoever proffers speech, do you draw a line overspeech and speaker.The fair one whom I am seeking with all my soul I do not seeamongst those present here.Where has he gone? He is not amongst those present; I donot see any sign of him in this assembly.I am casting my gaze in every direction and every place; I donot see any trace of his rose bower.Moslems, where has he gone, that illustrious one whom Iused to behold in the midst like a candle?  Speak his name; tor whoever has spoken his name, his boneswill not crumble in the tomb.Blessed is the man who has kissed his hand; at the time ofdeath his mouth has become sweet.Shall I give thanks for his countenance, or his character? Forthe world beholds none his like.If earth does not find his form, what matters it, seeing thathis heaven revolves in this love?Speak the nicknames of Shams al-DTn-i Tabriz; do not keephim concealed from the ears of the yearners.Last night I went into the midst of the assembly of my king;I saw my soul in a beaker in the hand of the saki.I said to him, “O soul of the soul of the sakis, tor God’s sakefill me a measure, and do not break your pledge.”Smiling sweetly he said, “Noble sir, I do you service; I re-spect you by the right and respect of my faith.”He brought a cup and kissed it and placed it in my hand, fullof wine shining like his own shining cheeks. I prostrated before him and drew the bowl to me; the winelighted a fire in me from its own brazier.When the saki had poured continuously and dispensed forme many glasses after that wise, that wine like red gold trans-ported me to its own quarry.I saw my garden fresh and gay with the rose of his cheek; Isaw my bread well baked with his hyacinthine brow.Let every man find his own fortune and portion in a tavern;who am I? I have found true sympathy to belong to me.I saw Bu Lahab there biting hard his hand, Bu Hurairaputting his hand in his own wallet; Bu Lahab was like the back (and no back sees the face),Bu Huraira turning his lace to his own moon and seventhheaven;  Bu Lahab plunged in thought, seeking proof and demonstra-tion, Bu Huraira his own proof and his own demonstration.Not every jar is suitable for wine; beware, stop up the jar,that the saki may produce another jar from his own cellar.I make this enough, that the Prince of the Assembly may tellyou the tale of his own myriad secret assemblies.I am you, you are I, O friend; do not depart from your ownbreast; do not deem yourself other, do not drive yourself fromyour own door.Do not mislead head and loot through your endless tempta-tion, that as one bewildered I should stamp the foot of crueltyon my own head.The one who like a shadow is never apart from your form, isI; do not, beloved, draw your dagger against your shadow.O tree, in every direction of which there are thousands ofshadows, cherish the shadows and do not cut them off fromtheir source.Hide all the shadows and naught them in the light; disclosethe countenance of the sun of your radiant cheek.The heart’s kingdom has become disordered through yourtwo-heartedness; mount the throne, do not step down fromyour own pulpit.“Reason is the crown” — so ‘All spoke in a similitude; bestowon the throne a new jewel out of your own essence.My drunkenness of today is not like yesterday’s drunkenness;do you not believe me? Take a glass, and drink!I am drowned in wine; the waters have carried away my rea-son. Intellect said, “Farewell, I will not become sober again.”  Reason and intellect have departed in madness out of theworld, like a pot overbrimming when it boils beyond measure.This mad, intoxicated heart burst its bonds and escaped; donot argue with the drunkards — say nothing; depart; keep silent.At dawn the watchman said to me from the ladder, “Lastnight I heard an uproar proceeding from the seventh heaven.Saturn said to Venus, ‘Strike your plectrum more gendy.Leo, seize Taurus by the horns and milk him.’See how as a result of terror the milk in Taurus’ nipples hasturned to blood! Behold how the Leo of the skies out of fearhas become like a mouse !Leo, charge fiercely; how long will you flee like a cur? Makedisplay, O moon-laced one; how long will you veil your face?Open your eyes to the six directions, behold the glitteringof the light; open your ears to heaven, you whose eyes havebecome ears.Hear the greeting from the Soul, that you may escape fromspeech; gaze upon the Form-fashioner, that you may escapefrom the forms.”I said to him, “Master, go, say, let what will be be; I am pureand newly free, slave to the dregs-seller.”Fear and hope lor you are assigned to the reason; wild crea-tures are the game for your grain and snare .Since the dregs of his anguish have taken me into protec-tion, speak not to me of these things; that task is yours — do youlabour!When union with the Beloved showed itself to Mansur, itwas right that the gallows should bring him to the heart’s Origin.I snatched a cap’s length from his robe; his cap’s length con-sumed my reason and head and foot.I broke off a thorn from the top of the wall of his garden;what itching and questing is in my heart from that thorn of his!  Since one morning through his wine this heart became alion-talcer, it is only meet that it should be smitten by the mon-ster of separation from him.Though heaven’s colt appeared refractory and untamed, itwas tethered and headstalled by the hand of His love.Though reason is high-ranking and very learned, its gownand turban have been pawned tor the cup of love.Many a heart came seeking refuge from His love; dragging italong He dragged it to Him, and gave it no quarter.One cold day a fur coat was in a river; I said to a naked man,“Jump in and seek, and bring it out!”It was not a fur coat, it was a bear in the river; it had fallen in,and the current was carrying it along.The man entered eagerly and reached the skin of the bear;that eagerness made him prisoner in the bear’s arms.I said to him, “Let go the fur coat, come back! Howlong and far you have remained through toiling and battlingwith it!”He said, “Go; the coat has so seized me that I have no hopeof escape from its powerful clutches.Every moment it immerses me a thousand times; there is noescape from its lover-squeezing claws.”Silence, of stories enough; just give a hint; what need has thereason for long volumes?They say, “The king oflove is not faithful.” Lies! They say,“Your night will never have a dawn.” Lies!They say, “Why do you slay yourself for love’s sake? There isno survival after the body’s death.” Lies!They say, “Your tears shed in love are vain; once the eyes areclosed, there will be no encounter.” Lies!They say, “When we have gone outside the cycle of time,beyond this soul of ours will not travel.” Lies!  Those persons who have not escaped from fancy say, “Thestories of the prophets were all mere fancies.” Lies!Those persons who have not gone on the right way say,“The servant has no way to come to God.” Lies!They say, “He who knows all secrets tells not the servant thesecrets and mysteries of the Unseen without intermediary!” Lies!They say, “They open not to the servant the heart’s secret,and He does not graciously carry the servant up to heaven.”Lies!They say, “That one who has earth in his composition willnever be familiar with the heavenly host.” Lies!They say, “The pure soul will never fly on the wings of loveout of this earthly nest to the free air.” Lies!They say, “That sun of God will never bring retribution forthe several atoms’ weight of evil and good of men.” Lies!Keep silent from speaking; and if anyone says to you,“Speech has no other expression but letters and sounds” — Lies!We two or three gay reprobates have gathered togetheron this side like camels, face to face, muzzles plunged in theprovender.From left and right every camel is coming, raging with de-sire, lips thrust out like camels, bringing up foam.Do not worry; not every camel finds the way to this sheep-cote, for they are in the lowlands and we are on top of themountain.How shall any attain the mountaintop by stretching up hisneck? Even though they bark like dogs, we will not worry abouttheir barking.If the world becomes all sea, enter the ark of Noah; howshould Noah’s ark be overwhelmed and destroyed?We are a mine of emeralds, a bane to the eye of the snake; hewho is bitten by sorrow, his portion is “Woe is me!”  All the world is full of grief in quest of rank and money; weare happy and glad and revered, drunk with joy in this protec-tion.The gnostics have become drunk; minstrel of gnosis, come,quickly utter a quatrain, come forward, take the tambourine.Cast wind into the forest, blow on the head of cypress andwillow, that willow and plane-tree rank by rank may toss theirheads.When the willow is dry and bald, it has neither leaves norfruit; how should it move its head to the breath and wind of Donot fear?The remedy for the dry and succourless is the blast divine,for He is engaged on action one by one, He is not weak andcontemptible.The dry palm-tree gave fruit to a Mary by the fiat of God; thedead found life anew from the breath divine.If the fool wags his chin, do not lose the path of Love;choose the trade of Love, count as folly all other trades.When you complete one ode, recite the praises of Shams-iDin and recall Tabriz, despite the villainous adversary.I have no need of wine, I am indifferent to lees and pureliquor; I thirst for my own blood, the time of battle has come.Draw the sharp sword, shed the blood of the envious un-til the head without the body circumambulates about its ownbody.Make a mountain of skulls, make a sea of our blood, thatearth and sand may drink blood in great gulps.You who are aware of my heart, go, do not stop up mymouth, else my heart will split, the blood will leap out of therent.Do not listen to the tumult, show no special favour; rulershipand authority are not so hand-woven.  I will enter the heart of the fire, I will become a morsel forthe fire; foretelling what, have they cut the navel of the sulphur-like soul?Fire is our child, it thirsts and is in bondage to us; we two arebecoming one so that no difference may prevail.Why does it crackle and smoke? Because two -colouredness isstill there; when it becomes fuel, it no longer crackles boastfully.Or if it leaps half- ablaze, it now becomes a coal, heart-athirstand black-faced, seeking union and marriage.The fire says, “Go, you are black and I am white.” The fuelsays, “You are burnt, I am preserved.”This side of it no face, that side of it no face, making seclu-sion in blackness between the two friends;Like an exiled Moslem, no way for him to come to peoplenor to emperor, left on one side like the fringe of a garment.Rather, he is like the ‘Anqa which was greater than all thebirds, but having no way to the sky, remained upon that moun-tain of Qaf.What am I to say to you? For you are fixed in your grief forbread, your back curved like a lam, your heart constricted like akaf.Ho, trouble-seeker, dash that pitcher against a rock, that Imay not draw river- water, that I may not suck it up.I will abandon water-carrying, I will drown myself in the sea,far from warfare and conflict, unaware of any description,Like pure spirits under the earth, their bodies like a bridewith earth on them for a coverlet.Look at that false prince with his little horse and litde saddle,knavish and scoundrelly, his head bound in cloth of gold;Since he disbelieves in death, he says, “Where, where isdoom?” Death comes to him from all six directions and says,“Here am I!”  Doom says to him, “Donkey, where now is all that gallopingabout? Those moustaches, that arrogant nose, that pride, thatwrath?Where is the beautiful idol, where happiness? To whom haveyou given your coverlet? A brick is now your pillow, your mat-tress the earth.” Bid farewell to eating and sleeping; go seek the true religion,that you may be a prince of eternity without your litde laws andcustoms.Do not unsoul this soul; do not convert this bread todung, O you who have flung the pearl into the bottom of thedung.Know that we are attached to dung for the pearl’s sake,O soul; be broken, and seek the pearl, proud and conceitedone.When you see a man of God, act like a man and offer himservice; when you experience anguish and affliction, do not fur-row your brow.This is my lampoon, O body, and that prince of mine is alsoI; how long will you go on speaking oflittle sins and shins ?io Shams al-Haqq-i TabrizI, you are yourself the water of life;what shall discover that water, save the tearful eye?What, loverhood and then concern for name and shame?That should not be; Love’s village is stone on stone!If you become lame from everything, depart far away; what,a far and stony way, and a lame man?If death is a man, let him come before me that I may drawhim fondly and tightly into my bosom;I will carry off from him a soul without hue and scent, he willseize from me a cloak of many colours. Impose on your soul the cruelty and tyranny of the Beloved;or if you will not, then welcome to war and war!  If you do not desire the scraping of His polishing, then belike a mirror full of rust.Lay your hand on your eye and say, “With all my eye!” Openyour eye; do not gaze distraught and stupefied.I cried out at midnight, “Who is in this house of the heart?”He said, “It is I, by whose countenance the sun and the moonare put to shame.”He said, “Why is this house of the heart full of all sorts ofimages?” I said, “These are the reflections of You, whose face isthe envy of Chigil.”He said, “What is this other image, full of the heart’sblood?” I said, “This is the image of me, heart wounded andfeet in the mire.”I bound the neck of my soul and brought it before Him as atoken: “It is a sinner oflove; do not acquit your sinner.”He gave me the end of a thread, a thread full of mischief andcraft; he said, “Pull, that I may pull, pull and at the same timedo not break.”From that tent of the soul the form of my Turk flashed outfairer than before; I reached my hand towards him; He struckmy hand, saying, “Let go!”I said, “You have turned harsh, like So-and-so.” He said,“Know that I am harsh for a good purpose, not harsh out ofrancour and spite.Whoever enters in saying, ‘It is I,’ I strike him on thebrow, for this is the sanctuary of Love, animal, it is not a sheep-cote.”Salah-i Dil u Din is truly the image of that Turk; rub youreyes, and behold the image of the heart, the image of theheart.  Why does the soul not take wing, when from the presence ofGlory the address of grace like sugar comes to the soul saying,“Come up”?How should a fish not leap nimbly from the dry land into thewater, when the sound of waves reaches its ear from the limpidsea?Why should the falcon not fly from the quarry towards theking, when it hears from drum and drumstick the tidings Return ?Why should not every Sufi begin to dance like a mote in thesun of immortality, that it may deliver him from decay?Such grace and beauty and loveliness and life -bestowing — canany man dispense with Him? What misery and error!Fly, fly, O bird, to your origin, for you have escaped from thecage and your feathers and wings are outspread.Journey away from the brackish water towards the water oflife; return to the high table of the soul from the porter’s lodge.Off, off! For we too, O soul, are arriving from this world ofseparation to that world of union.How long like children in this earthly world shall we fill ourskirts with dust and stones and crocks?Let us leave go of earth and fly heavenwards, let us flee fromchildhood to the banquet of men.Look not to see how the earthly mould has put you in a sack;split the sack and lift your head out of the sack.Take from the air this book in your right hand; you are not achild, not to know your right from your left.God said to Reason’s messenger, “Lift up your loot!”, to thehand of Death, “Beat the ear of concupiscence!”A call came to the spirit, “Speed away into the Unseen; takethe gain and the treasure, and lament the pain no more.”Do you call aloud, and proclaim that you are King; yoursis the grace of the answer, and yours is the knowledge of thequestion.  iThis time I am wholly involved in loverhood, this time I amwholly cut off from well-being.I have plucked out my heart from myself, I am living withsomething else, I have burned up from root and stock reasonand heart and thought. men, O men, manhood comes from me no more; themadman even does not meditate what I have meditated in myheart.The unlucky madman has fled from my turbulence; I amcommingled with death, I have flown into not-being. Today my reason has become wholly disgusted with me; itdesires to terrify me, thinking that I have no eyes.Why indeed should I be afraid of it? I have put on a grimacefor its sake. How should I be confused? But I am purposely soconfounded. am quit of the bowl of the stars and the blood of the skies;I have licked many a bowl for the benefit of the beggarly-facedpeople.For a good purpose I have remained in the prison of thisworld; what have I to do with prison? Whose property have Istolen?In the body’s prison I am drowned in blood, and of thetears of every stubborn one’s eyes I have rubbed in the dustmy bloodstained skirt.io Like an infant in the womb my nurture is of blood; ordinarymen are born once, I have been born many times.Examine me as much as you will, you will not recognize me,for I have become a hundred different manners from what youhave seen me to be.Enter my eye and behold me with my own sight, for I havechosen a dwelling place beyond all sight.You are drunk, drunk and happy, I am drunk and happy,  without a head; you are a lover with laughing lips, I am laugh-ing without any mouth.A strange bird am I, who of my own desire, without snare orcatcher, have crept into the cage;For the cage in the company of friends is sweeter than or-chard and garden; to please the Josephs I have reposed in thewell.Do not bewail his blow, do not claim sickness; I have given ahundred sweet lives to purchase this calamity.Like a silkworm at the cost of suffering you enter into satinand silk; give ear to a silkworm that has withered in the verygarment.You have withered in the tomb of the body; go before myIsrafil saying, “For my sake blow on the trumpet, for I am wearyof the tomb of the body.”No, no, like the well-tried falcon hood your eyes from your-self; I have put on brocade like a fine peacock.Bow your head to the physician saying, “Give me theantidote, for in this pleasant net I have swallowed manypoisons.”Before the confectioner of the soul you will become sweetand sweet of soul, for from the confection of the soul I havewaxed great as a sugarcane.He will make your essence confection better than by giving ahundred confections; I have not heard the delight of the soul’sconfection save from his lips.Be silent, for in speaking the confection falls out of themouth; without speech a man catches a scent such as I havesnuffed.Every unripe grape is lamenting, “O Shams-i TabnzI, come,for on account of unripeness and lack of savour I groan withinmyself.”  Yesterday my darling placed a golden crown on my head;however many blows you may strike, it will not fall from myhead.The cap-stitching king of eternity from his brows on mybrows sets the nightcap of love, so of course it remains tor ever.And even if my head does not remain with the cap, I willbecome all head like the moon; tor my pearl will appear brighterwithout casket and shell.Here is my head, and there a heavy mace; strike, to makeproof; and if this bone breaks, I am more full of marrow thanintellect and soul. That nut lacking pith which has chosen the husk — how shall ithave perceived the relish of the almond-essence of my Prophet?A sweetmeat full of his nuts, his sugar, and almonds sweetensmy throat and lip, gives light to my eyes.When you discover the pith, my son, and have learned todisregard the husk, when you have entered the quarter of Jesus,you will not any more say, “Where is my ass?”My soul, how long will you complain? Give up one assfrom the herd; behold the stoutness of the rider, not my leandraught-horse.Know that the stoutness of the lover derives from the stout-ness of his Beloved, for the pride of lovers arises from “I amGod Most Great.”io O sighing pains, do not say “Ah, ah,” say “Allah”; speak notof the well, speak of the throne, O Joseph my soul-nourisher.I was dead, I became alive; I was weeping, I becamelaughing; the power oflove came, and I became everlastingpower.  My eye is satiated, my soul is bold, I have the heart of a lion,I have become shining Venus.He said, “You are not mad, you are not appropriate to thishouse”; I went and became mad, I became bound inshackles.He said, “You are not intoxicated; go, for you belong not tothis party”; I went and became intoxicated, I became overflow-ing with joy. He said, “You are not slain, you are not drenched in joy”;before his life-giving face I became slain and cast down.He said, “You are a clever little man, drunk with fancy anddoubt”; I became a fool, I became straightened, I becameplucked up out of all.He said, “You have become a candle, the qibla of this as-sembly”; I am not of assembly, I am not candle, I have becomescattered smoke.He said, “You are shaikh and headman, you are leader andguide”; I am not a shaikh, I am not a leader, I have becomeslave to your command.He said, “You have pinions and wings, I will not give youwings and pinions”; in desire for his pinions and wings I be-came wingless and impotent.io New fortune said to me, “Go not on the way, do not be-come pained, for out of grace and generosity I am now comingto you.”Old love said to me, “Do not move from my breast”; I said,“Yes, I will not, I am at rest and remain.”You are the fountain of the sun, I am the shadow of the wil-low; when You strike my head, I become low and melting.My heart felt the glow of the soul, my heart opened andsplit, my heart wove a new satin, I became enemy of this raggedone.The form of the soul at dawn swaggered insolently; I was aslave and an ass-driver, I became king and lord. Your paper gives thanks for your limitless sugar, for it cameinto my embrace, and I dwelt with it.  My darkling earth gives thanks for my bent sky and sphere,tor through its gaze and circling I became light-receiving.The sphere of heaven gives thanks tor king and kingdom andangel, for through his generosity and bounty I have becomebright and bountiful.The gnostic of God gives thanks that we have outraced all;above the seven layers I have become a shining star.I was Venus, I became the moon, I became the two hun-dredfold slcy; I was Joseph, henceforth I have become the wax-ing Joseph.Famous moon, I am yours, look upon me and yourself, forfrom the trace of your smile I have become a smiling rose-garden.Move silently like a chessman, yourself all tongue, forthrough the face of the king of the world I have become happyand blissful.Of these two thousand I’s and we’s I wonder, which one amI? Give ear to my babble, do not lay your hand on my mouth.Since I have gone out of control, do not put glass on mypath, for if you do I will stamp and break all that I find.Because every moment my heart is confused with your fan-tasy, if you are joyous I am joyful, if you are sorrowing I amsorrowful.You give bitterness and I become bitter, you give grace andI become all grace; with you it is pleasant, O my sugar-lipped,sweet-chinned idol.You are the original — what person am I? A mirror in yourhand; whatever you show, that I become, I am a well-provedmirror.You are like the cypress of the meadow, I am like yourshadow; since I have become the shadow of the rose, I havepitched my tent beside the rose.  If without you I break off a rose, it will become a thorn inmy hand; and if I am all thorn, through you I am all rose andjasmine.Every moment I drain a bloody beaker of the blood of myheart; every instant I break my own pitcher against the saki’sdoor.Every second I reach out my hand towards the skirt of anidol, that he may scratch my cheek, that he may rend my shirt.The grace of Salah-i Dil u Din shone in the midst of myheart; he is the heart’s candle in the world; who am I? Elis bowl.I saw a tree and a fire. A call came, “My darling!” That fire iscalling me; am I Moses son of ‘Imran?I entered the wilderness with affliction, and tasted mannaand quails; for forty years like Moses I am wandering about thisdesert.Ask not about ship and sea; come, look at these marvels —how that for so many years I have been sailing a ship in this dryland.Come, soul! You are Moses, and this bodily form is yourstaff; when you pick me up I become a staff, when you cast medown I am a serpent.You are Jesus and I am your bird; you made a bird out ofclay; just as you breathe on me, even so I fly in the zenith.I am the pillar of that mosque against which the Prophetleaned; when he leans against another, I moan from the pain ofseparation.Lord of Lords and Formless Maker of forms, what form areYou drawing over me? You know; I do not know.Now I am stone, now iron; for a while I am all fire; now I ama balance without a weight, now I am both weight and balance.For one time I pasture here, another they pasture on me;now I am a wolf, now a sheep, now the form of a shepherd.  The material body came as a token; how shall the token re-main for ever? Neither this remains nor that; He who is mineknows that I am that.I circumambulate with the pilgrims, I circle around theBeloved; I have not the character of dogs, I do not go aroundcarrion.I am like a gardener; shovel laid on my neck, searching tor acluster of dates I go around the thorns —Not the kind of dates which, when you have eaten them,turn to phlegm and make one bilious, but the kind that makeswings to grow so that I circle like Taiyar.The world is a snake, and below it is a treasure very hidden;I am on top of the treasure, and circle about it like the tail of asnake.I am not grieving for a grain, though about this house Icircle deep in thought like the heron.I do not seek a house in the village, neither ox and fat herd,but I am intoxicated with the Prince and circle seeking thePrince.I am the companion of Khidar and momently seek his ap-proach, loot fast and circling, for like compasses I circle .Do you not know that I am sick? For I am seeking Galen; doyou not see that I am crop-siclc? For I circle the vintner.Do you not know that I am Simurgh? For I fly around Qaf;do you not know that I have caught the scent? For I circleabout the rosebower.Count me not one of these men; recognize a phantom cir-cling; if I am not a phantom, O soul, why do I circle about thesecrets?Why do I not become still? I beat about this and that, forhe has unminded me and made me drunk, therefore I circleunevenly.  You say to me, “Go not so hurriedly, tor that shows disre-spect”; I am ashamed of respect, therefore I circle shame.I made bread my pretext, but I am intoxicated with thebaker; it is not about gold I circle, I circle about vision.In every image which confronts me I behold the engraver;know that it is tor love of Laila that like Majnun I circle.In this palace of self-sacrificers in which is not contained eventhe head, I, bewildered, am pardonable if I circle without aturban.I am not a flame-moth burning my wings and pinions, I am amoth of the King, for I circle about the lights.Why do you bite my lips privily saying, “Be silent, do notspeak”? Is it not your doing, your craft too that I circle aboutspeech?Come, Shams-i Tabriz!, like twilight although you flee; liketwilight in the track of your sun I circle about these lands.I am not that luckless lover, to flee from the Beloved; I donot hold that dagger in my hand to flee from batrie.I am that plank with which the carpenter has much to do, Ido not shrink from the axe or flee from the nails.I am unselfed like a plank, I think not to oppose the axe; Iam fit only for the flames if I flee from the carpenter.I am as a worthless and cold stone if I do not journey oftto rubiness; I am as a dark and narrow cave if I flee from theCompanion of the Cave.I do not feel the kiss of the peach if I flee from leaflessness;I do not catch the scent of Tartary musk if I flee from theTartar.I am distressed with myself because I am not contained; it ismeet, when the head is not contained, if I flee from the turban.Many centuries are required for this fortune to emerge;where shall I find it again, if this time I flee?  It is not that I am sick and unmanly, that I shun the fairones; it is not that my bowels are corrupt, that I flee from thevintner.I am not mounted on a paclcsaddle to remain then in thearena; I am not a farmer of this village, to flee from the Prince.I say, “My heart, have done”; my heart replies, “I am in thequarry of gold, why should I flee from the lavishing of riches?”When the thunder and lightning laugh, I recite paeans ofpraise, I am full of light as the clear sky, I am circling around themoon.My tongue is knotted like Moses because of the Pharaohs,for jealousy lest a Pharaoh should discover my proof.Bind my hands if you find me in the encampment of aPharaoh, for I am the Sultan’s spy.I am not a spy, I am not a scandal, I am one of the secrets ofsanctity; let me go, since I am drunk, that I may let fly a vaunt.From wine wind arises, for wine stirs up wind, especially thekind of wine through which I am distraught.If a whiff of this wine were to reach all the world’s ascetics,what a desolation then will appear, what shall I say? I know not.Why speak of the wine? For if a whiff of those drunkards’breaths were to penetrate stone and marble, they would brag,“I am the Water of Life.”My being is a bachelor’s apartment, and those drunkardsare gathered together therein; my heart is distraught to knowwhether I am one of them — amazing! — or myself I am they.Whether I am their congener, or whether I am other thanthey, I do not know; all I know is this, that I am in peace andwell-being.  I went to the physician of the soul, I said, “Look at my hand.I am heartlorn and sick at once, both lover and intoxicated.I have a hundred ailments — would that they were all one!With all these distempers I have reached the very end.”He said, “Were you not dead?” I said, “Yes, but when yourscent came to me I leaped out of the grave.”That spiritual form, that orient divine, that Joseph of Canaanon whose account I wounded my hand, Gently, gently came towards me and laid a hand on myheart. He said, “Of what band are you?” I said, “Of this band.”When I brawled he gave me wine, and I drank; my palecheek glowed and I ceased to brawl.Then I stripped off my clothes, I raged like a drunkard, I satin that drunkards’ ring, on the right hand.I drank a hundred jars, I roared a hundred ways, I scattered ahundred glasses, I shattered a hundred pitchers.Those folk worshipped the golden calf; I am a mangy calf, ifI do not worship Love. Again the spiritual king is secredy calling me, he is drawingme up royally from these depths.I am loot-tied to you, O soul, I am intoxicated with you,my soul, I am in your hand, my soul, whether I am arrow orthumbstall.If I am nimble, you make me so, if I am drunk you make meso, if I am lowly you make me so, if I am in being, you makeme so.You brought me into the circling sphere when you intox-icated me with you; since now you have sealed the vat, I toohave closed my mouth.  Not for one single moment do I let hold of you, for you aremy whole concern, you are my whole affair.I eat and enjoy your candy, I labour at your counselling;I am a heart-wounded quarry, you are my heart-devouringlion.You might say that my soul and your soul are one; I swear bythis one soul that I care not tor other than you.I am a bunch of herbs from the garden of your beauty, I ama strand of your union’s robe of honour. Around you this world is thorn on the top of a wall; in thehope of culling the rose of union it is a thorn that I scratch.Since the thorn is like this, how must be your rosebower! you whose secrets have swallowed and borne away mysecrets.My soul, in the sky the sun is the moon’s companion; I knowthat you will not leave me in this assembly of strangers.I went to a dervish and he said, “May God befriend you!”You might say that through his blessing a king such as you be-came my friend.I beheld the whole world to be a painting on the gates of abath; you who have taken my turban away, likewise towards you stretch my hand.io Every congener bursts his chain to come to his congener;whose congener am I, who am held fast in this snare here?Like a thief, my soul, you ever steal around me; I know whatyou are seeking, crafty sweetheart of mine.My soul, you are hiding a candle under the cloak, you desireto set fire to my stook and rick.O my rosebower and rosegarden, O cure of my sickness, OJoseph of my vision and lustre of my market,You are circling round my heart, I am circling round yourdoor; circling am I giddily in your hand like a compass.  In the gladness of your face if I tell the tale of woe, if thensorrow drinks my blood, by Allah, I deserve it.To the beat of the tambourine of your decree all these crea-tures are dancing; without your melody does a single lute -stringdance? I do not think so.The voice of your tambourine is hidden, and this dance ofthe world is visible; hidden is that itch, wherever I scratch.I will be silent out of jealousy, because from your sugarcane Iam a cloud scattering sugar, it is only your candy that I rain.I am in water, in earth, in fire, in air; these tour are all aroundme, but I am not of these four.Now I am Turk, now Hindu, now the master, now Zangi; it is ofyour engraving, my soul, that I believe or disbelieve.Tabriz, my heart and soul are with Shams-i Haqq here, eventhough in body I vex him no more.I am a painter, a picture-maker, every moment I fashion anidol, then before you I melt away all the idols,I raise up a hundred images and mingle them with spirit;when I see your image, I cast them in the fire.You are the vintner’s saki or the enemy of the sober, or theone who lays waste every house I build.Over you the soul is poured forth, with you it is mingled;since the soul has the perfume of you, I will cherish the soul.Every drop of blood that flows out of me says to your dust,“I am one in colour with your love, I am the playmate of youraffection.”In the house of water and clay this heart without you is des-olate; either enter the house, O soul, or I will abandon thehouse.  I am your disciple, for all that I am stupid and twisted ofmouth, so that I may learn one smile from your smiling lip.Fountain of learning, do you want me tor a pupil? What de-vice shall I invent to stitch myself to you?At least I may descry through the crack of the door the light-ning of your cheek; from that fire of the portico I will kindle ahundred candles.One instant you rob me of my load on the way, saying, “I amthe tithe-collector”; one instant you go before me, meaning, “Iam the guide.” Now you drive me to sin, now towards repentance; twist myhead and my tail, for I am a compressed hamza.In sin and in penitence, like a fish on the pan, this side andthat side I am burning on the pan.On your pan I am turning this way and that; in the darknessof night, with you I am brighter than day.Enough, I am all diversified in craft and thought; for oneinstant like turquoise, for one instant like PIruz.Once again, once again I have escaped from my chains, Ihave burst out of these bonds and this trap which seizes theinfirm.Heaven, the bent old man full of wizardry and deceit —by virtue of your youthful fortune I have escaped from thisold man.Night and day I ran, I broke away from night and day; ask ofthis sphere how like an arrow I sped.Why should I fear sorrow? For I am the comrade of death.Why should I fear the general? For I have escaped from theprince.  Reason bore me down with anxiety for forty years; sixty-twohas made me quarry, and I have escaped from devising.All creatures have been made deaf or blind by predestination;I have escaped from the attack and retreat of predestination,and from predestination.Outwardly skin, inwardly stone, the fruit is a prisoner; like afig, I have escaped from that skin and that stone.Delay causes mischief, and haste is of the devil; my heart hasescaped from haste, and I have escaped from delay.In the first place blood was the food, in the end blood be-came milk; when the teeth of reason sprouted, I escaped fromthat milk;I ran after bread, a loaf or two, by imposture; God gave me afood, so that I escaped from imposture.Be silent, be silent, speak no more in detail; I will speakof the interpretation, I have escaped from the stench of garlic.Like a mirror my soul displays secrets; I am able not to speak,but I am unable not to know.I have become a fugitive from the body, fearful as to thespirit; I swear I know not — I belong neither to this nor tothat.Seeker, to catch a scent is the condition of dying; look notupon me as living, for I am not so.Look not on my crookedness, but behold this straight word;my talk is an arrow, and I am as a bow.This gourdlike head on top of me, and this dervish habit ofmy body — whom am I like, whom am I like in this market ofthe world?Then this gourd on my head, full of liquor — I keep it upsidedown, yet I let not a drop trickle from it.And even if I do let trickle, do you behold the power of God,that in exchange tor that drop I gather pearls from the sea.  My eyes like a cloud gather pearls from that sea; this cloud ofmy spirit rises to the heaven of fidelity.I rain in the presence of Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz, that liliesmay grow in the form of my tongue.Said, my spirit is moving in the track of love, but because ofyour weariness my tongue is tied.Like an arrow I am flying towards your joyous company;beloved, do not break my bow with cruelties.Like a tent I remain standing before you on one loot;beloved, bring me into your tabernacle and seat me there.Ho, lay that flagon’s lip on my dry lip, then hear the veritablemagic from my mouth;Hear the story of Babylon and the tale of Va’il, tor by way ofmeditation I travel the world.Excuse me if my turbulence goes beyond bounds, since lovegrants me security not for a single moment.When you are weary, I am weary of your weariness; whenyou wash your hands of me, I bite my fingers.On the night when you dispense light like the moon untildaybreak, in your wake I am running like a star;On the day when you put up your head from the east like thesun, like the sun I am altogether spirit.But on the day when like the spirit you are hidden from myeyes, like the heart of a bird I am fluttering with anxiety.On the day when your light shines through my window, inmy apartment I dance for joy like a mote.Rational soul, be silent and depart into hiding like thethought, so that he who thinks of causes only may not find mytrack.  I am the slave who set the master tree, I am the one whotaught the teacher.I am that soul which was born of the world yesterday, andyet erected the ancient world.I am the wax whose claim is this, that it was I who made steelsteel.I have painted with surmeh many a sightless one, I havetaught many a one without intelligence. I am the black cloud in the night of grief who gladdened theday of festival.I am the amazing earth who out of the fire of love filled withair the brain of the sky.In joy that king slept not last night, because I the slave re-membered him.It is not to blame, since you intoxicated me, if I am scan-dalous and wrought injustice.Silence, for the mirror is rusting over; when I blew upon it, itprotested against me.I made a journey, I ran to every city, no man I saw with yourgrace and beauty.I returned from banishment and exile, once more I attainedthis felicity.Since I became far from the garden of your countenance, Isaw no rose, I plucked not one fruit.Since by bad luck I fell far from you, I have endured troublefrom every unlucky one. What shall I say? I was utterly dead without you; God hascreated me anew once more.  Amazing! Would you say that I have beheld your face?Would you say that I have heard your voice?Suffer me to kiss your hand and loot; give festively, for todayis festival.Joseph of Egypt, I have brought you as a present such abright mirror.How close your soul is to my soul! For whatever thing youare thinking, I know.I have a token even closer than this; come close, and beholdmy token.In dervish guise you come into the midst; do not jest andsay, “I am in the midst.”I am like the column amidst your house; I am like a water-spout hanging down from your roof.I am a sharer of your secrets on the day of mustering andresurrection, I am not a passing host like worldly friends.In your banquet I go round like the wine, in time of yourbatde I go before you like a lance.If like lightning I make a trade of dying, like the lightning ofyour beauty I am without a tongue.Always I am joyful; it makes no difference whether I yield mysoul, or seize a soul.If I give you my soul, it will be good trade, tor in exchangetor a soul you will give me a hundred worlds.In this house thousands and more are dead; there you areseated saying, “Behold my household!”A handful of dust says, “I was once a tress”; another says, “Iam a bone.”You become bewildered; then suddenly Love comes saying,{“Come to me, tor I am the one eternally alive.Embrace my smooth breast to your breast, so that I may}deliver you this very instant from yourself. ”  Silence, Khusrau, speak no more of Shinn; my mouth isburning with sweetness.Out of all the world I choose you alone; do you deem it rightfor me to sit sorrowful?My heart is like a pen in your hand; through you it is,whether I am glad or grieve.What shall I be other than what you wish? What shall I seeexcept what you show?Now you cause thorns to grow from me, now roses; now Ismell roses, now I pluck thorns.Since you keep me so, I am so — since you wish me so, Iam so.In that vat where you dispense dye to the heart, what shouldI be? What my love and hate?You were the first, and you will be the last; do you make mylast better than my first.When you are hidden, I am of the infidels; when you appear,I am of the faithful.What do I possess other than the thing you have given? Whatare you searching for in my pocket and sleeve?Come, for today we are the quarry of the King, we have noneed for self and the world.Come, for today like Moses son of ‘Imran {with manliness}we will lift up dust from the sea.All night we were fallen like a staff; now that day has comewe are restless as serpents.Having circumambulated round our own breast, we bringout of the soul’s pocket the White Hand.    By that power whereby a serpent became a staff, every nightwe are like a staff, daily a serpent;For arrogant Pharaoh we are serpents, for Moses we arestaves and obedient.By zeal we shed the blood of Nimrods; do not regard thefact that we are slender as gnats.We will exceed over lions and elephants, though in the handof that Lion we are helpless.Though like camels we are crooked of nature, like camels wetravel smoothly towards the Kaaba.io We will not attach our hearts to a two-days’ fortune, for weare successful in everlasting fortune.Like sun and moon we are near and far, like love and theheart we are hidden and patent.For the sake of blood-lapping, blood -devouring Love we areas blood in the platter of Love’s dogs.As fish in the time of silence we are silent, in the time ofspeech we are the dustless moon.I was intent on seeking a stratagem, that that moon-facedone might set his face on mine .I said, “I have one word in my mind; come forward, that Imay speak it in your ear.Last night, dear soul, I saw a dream, and I desire to seekfrom you its interpretation.I have none intimate with this dream but you; do you listen,my king whose habit is to conceal.” Fie moved his head and laughed — that head which knowsme hair by hair —As if to say, “You are hatching a trick to play on me, for I amthe mirror of every hue and scent.”I am as a plaything in his hands, for I am the picture drawnby his gold-stitching needle.  Not lifeless shall be the image which he has made; I am hisleast image, I am therefore in ecstasy.I departed, ridding the world of the trouble of my presence,I escaped from anguish with my life;I bade farewell to my companions, I transported my soul tothe signless world.I went forth from this house of six doors, gaily I carried mybaggage to placelessness.When I beheld the master of the hunt of the Unseen I flewlike an arrow, carrying my bow;When the polo-stick of death approached me, I carried offfrom the midst the ball of felicity.A marvellous moon shone through my window; I went tothe roof, carrying a ladder.The roof of heaven which is the assembly-place of souls, wasfairer than I had ever imagined.Since my rose-branch had become withered, I carried it backagain to the garden and rosebower.As there was no purchaser for my coin, I carried it quickly tothe source of the source of the mine;From these counterfeiters I carried also as a present a filing ofthe soul to the goldsmith.In the Unseen the boundless world I saw; to that bound Itransported my tent.Do not weep for me, for I am happy because of this journey,inasmuch as I have travelled the road to the realm of paradise.Write this saying upon my tomb, that I have come safely outof trial and tribulation.Sleep sweetly, body, in this earth, for I have carried yourmessage up to heaven.Bind up my chin, for I have carried all lamentations to theCreator oflamentation.  Speak no more the grief of your heart, tor I have carried yourheart to the presence of Him who knows all secrets.We are dancing like motes, we obey the command of yoursun.Every dawn out of Love’s east like the sun we rise.We thresh about in dry and wet, we become not dry, norturn wet.We have heard brasses making much lament, “O light, shine,that we may become gold.”For the sake of their need and anguish we rise to the spheresand the stars.We come as amber for a necklace from the silver-bosomedBeloved.We have beaten our dervish frock, to emerge from that to agown of Shushtar.We are the drainers of pure wine on the path of poverty, weare intoxicated with the red wine .If they impose on us the world’s poison, we come as sugarout of our inward parts.On the day when brave men flee, we come as Sanjar in thethick of the batde;We make wine of the foeman’s blood, then we drain it andcome like daggers.We are the ring of drunken lovers, every day we come as aring on the door.He wrote the sign-manual of security for us; how should wecome to the rattle of mere death?In the supernal kingdom and placelessness we come on thesteed of the green sphere.We went into hiding from the world of the flesh, we comemore manifest in the world of Love.  In the body the soul has become pure; we become bodilessand come yet purer.Shams-i Tabriz is the soul of the soul; we come shoulder toshoulder in the house of eternity.Last night I vowed anew, I swore an oath by your life,That I would never remove my eyes from your lace; if Yousmite with the sword, I will not turn from You.I will not seek the cure from any other, because my pain is ofseparation from You.If You should cast me into the fire, I am no true man if Iutter a sigh. I rose from your path like dust; now I return to the dust ofyour path.If I do not express in speech your elegance, I have your lovewithin my breast.If I smell a rose without your love, forthwith burn me like athorn.If I am silent as a fish, yet I am restless as the waves and the sea.You who have set a seal on my lips, draw my toggle towardsYou. What is your design? What should I know? I only know thatI am in this train.I chew the cud of grief for you like a camel, like a ragingcamel I bring up foam.Though I keep hidden and do not speak, in the presence ofLove I am manifest.I am like a seed under the soil, I am waiting upon the signalof spring,  That without my own breath I may breathe sweetly, thatwithout my own head I may scratch a head.On the day when you pass over my grave, bring to mind thisterror and confusion of mine;Fill full of light that bottom of the tomb, O eye and lamp ofmy light,That in the tomb this patient body of mine may prostrate toyou in gratitude.Harvest of roses, pass me not in haste, make me happy a mo-ment with that perfume;And when you pass by, do not suppose that I am far fromyour window and portico.If the stones of the tomb have blocked my way, I am un-wearying on the path of fantasy.Though I should have a hundred winding-sheets of satin, Iam naked without the vestment of your form.I will emerge into the hall of your palace, in breaking a holein the wall perchance I am like an ant.I am your ant, you are Solomon; not for one moment leaveme without your presence.I have fallen silent; do you speak the rest, for I am shunninghenceforth my own speaking and listening.Shams-i Tabriz, do you invite me, since your invitation is myblast of the trumpet.We are living by the light of Majesty, we are strangers andexceeding familiar.The carnal soul is like a wolf, but in our secret heart we aresuperior to Joseph of Egypt.  The moon repents of his conceit when we display to him outface;The feathers and pinions of the sun consume when we openour feathers and pinions. This form of man is a veil; we are the qibla of all prostrations.Regard that breath, do not see the Adam in us, that we maytransport your soul with grace.Iblis looked with a separate regard, he supposed that we areapart from God.Shams-i Tabriz himself is the pretext; it is we who are in thebeauty of grace, we.For the sake of a veil say to men, “He is the noble king andwe are beggars.”io What have we to do with kingship and beggary? We arehappy because we are worthy of the king.We are effaced in the beauty of Shams-i Tabriz; in that ef-face ment neither he is, nor are we.O world of water and clay, since I knew you I have known amyriad tribulations and pains.You are the pasturage of asses, not the abode of Jesus; whyhave I known this pasturage of asses?You first spread the table, then gave me sweet water; youbound me hand and foot, so that I knew hand and foot.Why should you not bind hand and foot, seeing God calledyou a cradle? Like a tree I lift up my hands from the earth in desire for thatOne from whom I knew desire.“O cluster, how is it that in childhood you become like aperfect old man?” Answer came, “I escaped from youthful pas-sion when I knew the zephyr.”The branch goes upwards because it came from above; I has-ten towards my origin, because I know my origin.  How long shall I speak of “below” and “above”? Placeless-ness is my origin, I am not of place, for I know whence placecomes.No, be silent, depart into nonexistence, become naught innonexistence; behold, how I know things from no-things!Since my sun and star arose higher than form, I am happierto go from realities into realities.I have become lost in realities — so it is sweeter; I will notreturn towards form, I will not look upon the two worlds.I am melting in meanings till I become of one colour withHim, tor meaning is as water and I am as sugar.No man’s heart wearies of the life of his own soul; naturallyin view of this reality I will not recall form.I stroll from garden to garden with the spiritual ones, grace-ful as a red rose and fresh as a nenuphar am I.I am as a wave to the body’s boat, I break it plank by plank; Ismash myself when I am anchor to myself.And if out of hardness of heart I am slack in my affairs,swifriy out of the sea surge my flames of fire .I am laughing happily as gold amidst his fire, because if Iemerge from the fire I congeal as gold.From an incantation like a snake I have put down myhead on his line — brother, what will fall on my head from hisline?I was weary of form, I came towards attributes; each at-tribute said, “Enter here, for I am the green sea.”Shams-i Tabriz, I have a realm like Alexander; conse-quently out of grace I am army-leader towards the armies ofmeaning.  Give me that last night’s wine, tor I am intoxicated byyour potion; Hatim of the world, give into my hand a hugecup.Saki of true men, turn not your face from me tor onemoment; do not break my heart, else I shall break cup andglass.A cup was in my hand, I flung it down and broke it; Iwounded the soles of a hundred naked feet with that glass.You are a glass-worshipper because your liquor is from glass;my wine is not of must, so why should I worship glass? Drink, my heart, the spiritual wine, and sleep secure and freeof care; for I have beheaded anguish, I have escaped from sor-row and anguish.My heart has gone up, my body has gone down; where am I,the helpless one? I am neither above nor below.What a fine hanging apple am I, who cannot endure withoutyour stone! How should I endure without bala if I am drunkwith alcist ?Ask of me, what a treasure this love is and what it holds; askconcerning me also of him, that he may say who I am.Why do you hang about the riverbanlc? Leap from the river,if you are a true man; leap from the river and seek for me, for Ihave leaped from the river.io If you remain, we remain, and if you go, we depart; whenyou ate I ate, when you sat I sat.I am that drunken drummer who went drunk into the arena,I tied my drum like a flag to the top of my lance.What a happy and unselfed king you are! Ho, silent as a fish —since I have escaped from being, why do you draw me back tobeing? I am that lover of your love who have no occupation but this,tor I have nothing but disapproval for him who is not a lover.I seek no heart but yours, I hurry only towards you; I do notsmell the roses of every garden, I have no heed tor every thorn.In you I have put my faith, my heart has become Mussul-man; my heart said to you, “Darling, I have no beloved likeyou.”Since you are my eye and tongue, I do not see two, I do notrecite two, I acknowledge none but the one darling that is you. Since I drink of your honey, why should I sell vinegar? Whyshould I labour tor my daily bread? It is not the case that I donot possess an ample allowance.I eat to my fill at this table of the Sultan’s sugarcakes, not as aguest of Satan; I have no appetite tor lunch.I will not grieve, I will not grieve, I will not boast of asceti-cism; if you think I have not abundant gold, behold my gold-pale cheeks.The Khusrau of the heart grieves only for Shinn; with whatheart should I grieve? After all, I have not a grieved heart.I would explain for all, both fearful and secure alike; but Ihave not the heart to speak of inward words,io You who are unbranded by madness, tell me now, how areyou? For I have no further traces of how and after what manner.Since from Tabriz has come the moon of Shams al-Haqq uDin to me, I have no care for the moon of the dormitory of thecommander.If I am hand-clapping, I belong not to the clappers; I amneither of this nor of that, I am of that mighty city.I am not for fluting and gambling, I am not for wine and  liquor, I am neither leaven nor crop-sickness, I am neither likethis nor like that.If I am drunk and dissolute, I am not drunk with wine likeyou; I am not of earth nor of water, I am not of the people oftime.The mind of the son of Adam — what knowledge has it ofthis utterance? For I am hidden by two hundred veils from theworld entire.Hear not these words as from me, nor from this clearthought, for I neither receive nor seize this outward and in-ward.Though your face is beautiful, the cage of your soul is ofwood; run away from me or you will burn, for my tongue is aflame.I am not of scent nor colour, I am not of fame nor shame;beware of my poplar arrow, for God is my bow.I seize not raw wine, nor borrow from anyone, I seize nei-ther breath nor snare, O my youthful fortune.I am as the rosebower of paradise, I am the joy-garden of theworld, for my spirit is flowing through the spirits of all men.The sugarbed of your phantom brings rose-sugar to me; inthe garden of realities I scatter the rose of a hundred petals.When I enter the rose-showering garden of union with you,make me sit down, for I am a target for your brand.Love, what a mate you are, how strange, how marvellous!When you seized my mouth, my expression went inwards.When my soul reaches Tabriz, to come to Shams al-Haqq uDin, I will bring to an end all the secrets of speech.There is a passion in my head that I have no inclination formankind, this passion makes me so that I am unaware of myself.The king oflove bestows every moment two thousand king-doms; I desire nothing from him save his beauty.  The girdle and cap of his love are enough for me in bothworlds; what matter if my cap falls? What care if I have no girdle?One morning his love transported my wounded heart to aplace where I transcended day and night, and have no knowl-edge of dawn. A journey befell my soul to the kingdom of realities, suchthat the sky and the moon say, “I have no such journey.”Through separation if my soul scatters pearls from my eyes,think not that I have not a heart full of pearls from him.What sugar-seller have I to sell sugar to me! Never on anyday he said, “Go, tor I have no sugar.”I would have shown a token of his beauty, but the twoworlds would be confounded; I have no inclination for suchclamour and riot.Tabriz, I have sworn that after Shams-i Din comes I will ingratitude lay down this head, for I have nothing but a head.The ravings which my enemy uttered I heard within myheart; the secret thoughts he harbored against me I also per-ceived.His dog bit my foot, he showed me much injustice; I do notbite him like a dog, I have bitten my own lip.Since I have penetrated into the secrets of individuals likemen of God, why should I take glory in having penetrated hissecret?I reproach myself that through my doubtings it so happenedthat purposely I drew a scorpion towards my own foot. Like Iblis who saw nothing of Adam except his fire, by God Iwas invisible to this insignificant Iblis.Convey to my friends why I am afflicted in mind; when thesnake bit my thigh I started away from the black rope.The blessed silent ones, their lips and eyes closed — by a wayunknown to any man, I ran into their thoughts; MO Since there is a secret and perfect way from heart to heart, Igathered gold and silver from the treasuries of hearts.Into the thought that was like a brazen stove I flung thedead dog; out of the thought that was like a rose bower Iplucked roses and jasmine.If I have hinted at the evil and good of my friends, I havespun that like a weaver as the choicest veil.When my heart rushed suddenly to a heart mighty andaware, out of awe for his heart I fluttered like the heart.As you are happy with your own state, how did you fall inwith me? Attend to your own business, for I am neither shaikhnor disciple.As far as you are concerned, brother, I am neither copper norred gold; drive me from your door, for I am neither lock norkey.Take it as if I had not ever spoken these words; if you hadbeen in my mind, by God I would not have quarreled.I closed my eyes to creation when I beheld his beauty, I be-came intoxicated with his beauty and bestowed my soul.For the sake of Solomon’s seal I became wax in all my body,and in order to become illumined I rubbed my wax.I saw his opinion and cast away my own twisted opinion; Ibecame his reed pipe and likewise lamented on his lip.He was in my hand, and blindly I groped for him with myhand; I was in his hand, and yet I inquired of those who weremisinformed.I must have been either a simpleton or drunk or mad thatfearfully I was stealing from my own gold.Like a thief I crept through a crack in the wall into my ownvine, like a thief I gathered jasmine from my own garden.Enough, do not twist my secret upon your fingertips, for Ihave twisted off out of your twisted fist.  Shams-i Tabriz, from whom comes the light of moon andstars — though I am grieving with sorrow for him, I am like thecrescent of the festival.Reason says, “I will beguile him with the tongue”; Love says,“Be silent. I will beguile him with the soul.”The soul says to the heart, “Go, do not laugh at me andyourself. What is there that is not his, that I may beguile himthereby?”He is not sorrowful and anxious and seeking oblivion that Imay beguile him with wine and a heavy measure.The arrow of his glance needs not a bow that I should be-guile the shaft of his gaze with a bow.He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world ofearth, that I should beguile him with gold and the kingdomof the world.He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not lustfulthat I should beguile him with women.Angels start away from the house wherein this form is, sohow should I beguile him with such a form and likeness?He does not take a flock of horses, since he flies on wings; hisfood is light, so how should I beguile him with bread?He is not a merchant and trafficker in the market of the worldthat I should beguile him with enchantment of gain and loss.He is not veiled that I should make myself out sick and uttersighs, to beguile him with lamentation.I will bind my head and bow my head, for I have got outof hand; I will not beguile his compassion with sickness orfluttering.Hair by hair he sees my crookedness and feigning; what’shidden from him that I should beguile him with anythinghidden.  He is not a seeker of fame, a prince addicted to poets,that I should beguile him with verses and lyrics and flowingpoetry.The glory of the unseen form is too great for me to beguile itwith blessing or Paradise. Shams-i Tabriz, who is his chosen and beloved — perchance Iwill beguile him with this same pole of the age.My mother was fortune, my father generosity and bounty; Iam joy, son of joy, son of joy, son of joy.Behold, the Marquis of Glee has attained felicity; this cityand plain are filled with soldiers and drums and flags.If I encounter a wolf, he becomes a moonfaced Joseph;if I go down into a well, it converts into a Garden ofEram.He whose heart is as iron and stone out of miserliness is nowchanged before me into a Hatem of the age in generosity andbounty. Dust becomes gold and pure silver in my hand; how thenshould the temptation of gold and silver waylay me?I have an idol such that, were his sweet scent scatteredabroad, even an idol of stone would receive life through joy.Sorrow has died for joy in him of “may God bind yourconsolation”; how should not such a sword strike the neck ofsorrow?By tyranny he seizes the soul of whom he desires; justices areall slaves of such injustice and tyranny.What is that mole on that face? Should it manifest itself, outof desire for it forthwith maternal aunt would be estrangedfrom paternal uncle. I said, “If I am done and send my story, will you finish it andexpound it?” He answered, “Yes.”  When I am asleep and crumbling in the tomb, should youcome to visit me, I will come forth with speed.You are tor me the blast of the trumpet and the resurrection,so what shall I do? Dead or living, wherever you are, there am I.Without your lip I am a frozen and silent reed; whatmelodies I play the moment you breathe on my reed!Your wretched reed has become accustomed to your sugarlip; remember wretched me, for I am seeking you. When I do not find the moon of your countenance, I bindup my head veil myself in mourning; when I do not find yoursweet lip, I gnaw my own hand.The time has come for us to become madmen in your chain,to burst our bonds and become estranged from all;To yield up our souls, no more to bear the disgrace of such asoul, to set fire to our house, and run like fire to the tavern.Until we ferment, we shall not escape from this vat of theworld — how then shall we become intimate with the lip of thatflagon and bowl?Listen to true words from a madman: do not suppose thatwe become true men until we die . It is necessary that we should become more inverted than thetip of a comb in the top of the twisted tress of felicity;Spread our wings and pinions like a tree in the orchard, if likea seed we are to be scattered on this road of annihilation.Though we are of stone, we shall become like wax for yourseal; though we be candles, we shall become a moth in the trackof your light.  Though we are kings, we shall travel straight as rooks foryour sake, that we may become blessed through your queen onthis chessboard.In the face of the mirror of love we must not breathe a wordof ourselves; we must become intimate with your treasure whenwe are changed to waste.Like the tale of the heart we must be without head or end-ing, that we may become dwellers in the heart of lovers like atale.If he acts the seeker, we shall attain to being sought; if heacts the key, we shall become all the wards of the lock.If Mustafa does not make his way and couch in our hearts,it is meet that we should lament and become like the WailingColumn.No, be silent; for one must observe silence towards thewatchman when we go towards the pavilion by night.Last night my soul cried, “O exalted sphere of heaven, youhang indeed inverted, with flames in your belly.“Without sin and crime, eternally revolving, upon your bodyin its complaining is the deep indigo of mourning,“Now happy, now unhappy, like Abraham in the fire; at onceking and beggar like Ibrahlm-i Adham.“In form you are terrifying, yet your state is full of anguish:you turn round like a millstone and writhe like a snake.”Heaven the blessed replied, “How should I not fear that onewho makes the Paradise of the world as Hell?“In his hand earth is as wax, he makes it Zangi and the master, hemakes it falcon and owl, he makes it sugar and poison.“He is hidden, friend, and has set us forth thus patent so thathe may become concealed.  “How should the ocean of the world be concealed understraws? The straws have been set adancing, the waves tumblingup and down;“Your body is like the land floating on the waters of the soul;your soul is veiled in the body alike in wedding feast or sorrow,io “In the veil you are a new bride, hot-tempered and obsti-nate; he is railing sweedy at the good and the bad of the world.“Through him the earth is a green meadow, the heavens areunresting; on every side through him a fortunate one pardonedand preserved.“Reason a seeker of certainty through him, patience a seekerof help through him, love seeing the unseen through him, earthtaking the form of Adam through him.“Air seeking and searching, water hand-washing, we Messiah-like speaking, earth Mary -like silent.“Behold the sea with its billows circling round the earthyship; behold Kaabas and Meccas at the bottom of this well ofZamzam!” The king says, “Be silent, do not cast yourself into the well,tor you do not know how to make a bucket and a rope out ofmy withered stumps.”Every day I bear a burden, and I bear this calamity for a pur-pose:I bear the discomfort of cold and December’s snow in hopeof spring.Before the fattener-up of all who are lean, I drag this so ema-ciated body;Though they expel me from two hundred cities, I bear it forthe sake of the love of a prince; Though my shop and house be laid waste, I bear it in fidelityto a tulip bed.  God’s love is a very strong fortress; I carry my soul’s baggageinside a fortress.I bear the arrogance of every stonehearted stranger for thesake of a friend, of one long-suffering;For the sake of his ruby I dig out mountain and mine; for thesake of that rose -laden one I endure a thorn.For the sake of those two intoxicating eyes of his, like theintoxicated I endure crop sickness;For the sake of a quarry not to be contained in a snare, Ispread out the snare and decoy of the hunter.He said, “Will you bear this sorrow till the Resurrection?”Yes, Friend, I bear it, I bear it.My breast is the Cave and Shams-i Tabrlzl is the Companionof the Cave. I bear ridicule for the sake of the Companion ofthe Cave.If I weep, if I come with excuses, my beloved puts cottonwool in his ears.Every cruelty which he commits becomes him, every crueltywhich he commits I endure.If he accounts me nonexistent, I account his tyranny gen-erosity.The cure of the ache of my heart is the ache for him; howshall I not surrender my heart to his ache?Only then are glory and respect mine, when his glorious loverenders me contemptible.Only then does the vine of my body become wine, when thewine-presser stamps on me and spurns me underfoot.I yield my soul like grapes under the trampling, that my se-cret heart may make merry,Though the grapes weep only blood, for I am vexed with thiscruelty and tyranny.  iHe who pounds upon me puts cotton wool in his ears say-ing, “I do not press unwittingly.“If you disbelieve, you are excusable, but I am the Abu’lHiltam the expert in this affair.“When you burst under the labor of my feet, then you willrender much thanks to me.”I have got out of my own control, I have fallen into uncon-sciousness; in my utter unconsciousness how joyful I am withmyself!The darling sewed up my eyes so that I might not see otherthan him, so that suddenly I opened my eyes on his face.My soul fought with me saying, “Do not pain me”; I said,“Take your divorce.” She said, “Grant it”; I granted it.When my mother saw on my cheek the brand of your loveshe cut my umbilical cord on that, the moment I was born.If I travel to heaven and read the Tablet of the Unseen, Oyou who are my soul’s salvation, without you how I am ruined!When you cast aside the veil the dead became alive; the lightof your face reminded me of the Covenant of Alast.When I became lost, O soul, through love of the king of theperis, hidden from self and creatures, I am as if peri-born myself.I said to the Tabriz of Shams-i Din, “O body, what are you?”Body said, “Earth”; Soul said, “I am distraught like the wind.”Without you, Darling, in both worlds I have seen no joy;many wonders I have seen, a wonder like you I have not seen.They said, “The blaze of fire will be the infidel’s portion”;none have I seen exempted of your fire save Bu Lahab.  I have oft laid the ear of my soul at the window of the heart;I have heard much discourse, but I have seen no lips.Suddenly you scattered compassion on your servant; I sawno cause for that save your infinite tenderness.Chosen saki, apple of my eyes, the like of you never appearedin Persia, in Arabia I never saw.Be lavish with that wine whose juice never came to festivegathering and that glass the equal of which I saw not in Aleppo.Pour wine in such abundance that I set out a foot from my-self, for in selfhood and existence I have seen only weariness.You who are sun and moon, you who are honey and sugar,you who are mother and father, no lineage have I seen but you.O infinite love, O divine manifestation, you are both stay andrefuge; an epithet equal to you I have not heard.We are iron filings and your love is the magnet; you are thesource of all questing, in your quest none I have seen.Be silent, brother, dismiss learning and culture; till you re-cited culture, no culture in you I saw.Shams-i Haqq-i Tabriz, source of the source of souls, with-out the Basra of your being, no date have I ever known.Lord, what a Beloved is mine! I have a sweet quarry; I pos-sess in my breast a hundred meadows from his reed.When in anger the messenger comes and repairs towards me,he says, “Whither are you fleeing? I have business with you.”Last night I asked the new moon concerning my Moon. Themoon said, “I am running in his wake, my foot is in his dust.”When the sun arose I said, “How yellow of face you are!”The sun said, “Out of shame for his countenance I have a faceof gold.”“Water, you are prostrate, you are running on your headand face.” Water said, “Because of his incantation I move like asnake.”  “Noble fire, why do you writhe so?” Fire said, “Because ofthe lightning of his face my heart is restless.”“Wind-messenger of the world, why are you light of heart?”Wind said, “My heart would burn if the choice were mine.”“Earth, what are you meditating, silent and watchful?” Earthsaid, “Within me I have a garden and spring.”Pass over these elements, God is our succorer; my head isaching, in my hand I hold wine.If you have barred sleep to us, the way of intoxication isopen. Since I have one to assist, he offers wine in both hands.Be silent, that without this tongue the heart may speak;when I hear the speech of the heart, I feel ashamed of thisspeech.Weary not of us, for we are very beautiful; it is out of veryjealousy and proper pride that we entered the veil.On the day when we cast off the body’s veil from the soul,you will see that we are the envy and the despair of the moonand the Polestars.Wash your face and become clean for beholding us, else re-main afar, for we are beloveds of ourselves.We are not that beauty who tomorrow will become a crone;till eternity we are young and heart-comforting and fair ofstature.If that veil has become worn out, the beauty has not grownold; the life of the Veil is transient, and we are boundless life.When Iblls saw the veil of Adam, he refused; Adam called tohim, “You are the rejected one, not I.”The rest of the angels fell down prostrate, saying as theybowed themselves, “We have encountered a beauty:“Beneath the veil is an idol who by his qualities robbed us ofreason, and we, prostrate, fell.”  If our reason does not know the forms of the foul old menfrom those of the beauties, we are apostates from love,io What place is there for a beauty? For he is the Lion of God.Like a child we prattled, for we are children of the alphabet.Children are beguiled with nuts and raisins, else, how are wemeet for nuts and sesame-grains?When an old woman is hidden in helmet and chainmail, shesays, “I am the illustrious Rustam of the battle ranks.”By her boast all know that she is a woman; how should wemake a mistake, seeing that we are in the light of Ahmad?“The believer is discriminating” — so said the Prophet; nowclose your mouth, for we are guided rightly without speech. Hear the rest from Shams the Pride of Tabriz for we did nottake the end of the story from that king.Rise, lovers, that we may go towards heaven; we have seenthis world, so let us go to that world.No, no, for though these two gardens are beautiful and fair,let us pass beyond these two, and go to that Gardener.Let us go prostrating to the sea like a torrent, then let us gofoaming upon the face of the sea.Let us journey from this street of mourning to the weddingfeast, let us go from this saffron face to the face of the Judas treeblossom. Trembling like a leaf and twig from fear of falling, our heartsare throbbing; let us go to the Abode of Security.There is no escape from pain, since we are in exile, and thereis no escape from dust, seeing that we are going to a dustbowl.Like parrots green of wing and with fine pinions, let us be-come sugar- gatherers and go to the sugar- bed.These forms are signs of the signless fashioner; hidden fromthe evil eye, come, let us go to the signless.  It is a road full of tribulation, but love is the guide, giving usinstruction how we should go thereon;io Though the shadow of the king’s grace surely protects, yet itis better that on that road we go with the caravan.We are like rain falling on a leaky roof; let us spring from theleak and go by that waterspout.We are crooked as a bow, for the string is in our own throats;when we become straight, then we will go like an arrow fromthe bow.We cower like mice in the house because of the cats; if we arelion’s whelps, let us go to that Lion.Let us make our soul a mirror in passion for a Joseph; let usgo before Joseph’s beauty with a present. Let us be silent, that the giver of speech may say this; even ashe shall say, so let us go.Did I not say to you, “Go not there, tor I am your friend; inthis mirage of annihilation I am the fountain of life?”Even though in anger you depart a hundred thousand yearsfrom me, in the end you will come to me, tor I am your goal.Did I not say to you, “Be not content with worldly forms,tor I am the fashioner of the tabernacle of your contentment?”Did I not say to you, “I am the sea and you are a single fish;go not to dry land, lor I am your crystal sea?” Did I not say to you, “Go not like birds to the snare; come,tor I am the power of flight and your wings and feet?”Did I not say to you, “They will waylay you and make youcold, for I am the fire and warmth and heat of your desire?”Did I not say to you, “They will implant in you ugly qualitiesso that you will forget that I am the source of purity to you?”Did I not say to you, “Do not say from what direction theservant’s affairs come into order?” I am the Creator withoutdirections.  If you are the lamp of the heart, know where the road is tothe house; and if you are godlike of attribute, know that I amyour Master.Bring wine, for I am suffering crop sickness {hang-over}from the vintner; God has seized me, and I am thus held fast.By love’s soul, bring me a cup of wine that is the envy of thesun, tor I care nothing tor aught but love.Bring that which if I were to call it “soul” would be a shame,for the reason that I am pained in the head because of the soul.Bring that whose name is not contained in this mouth,through which the fissures of my speech split asunder.Bring that which, when it is not present, I am stupid andignorant, but when I am with it, I am the king of the subde andcrafty ones.Bring that which, the moment it is void of my head, I be-come black and dark, you might say I am of the infidels.Bring that which delivers out of this “bring” and “do notbring”; bring quickly, and repel me not, saying, “Whence shall Ibring it?”Bring, and deliver the roof of the heavens through the longnight from my abundant smoke and lamentations.Bring that which after my death, even out of my dust, willrestore me to speech and thanksgiving even as Najjar.Bring me wine, for I am guardian of wine like a gob-let, for whatever has gone into my stomach I deliver backcompletely.Najjar said, “After my death would that my people might beopen-eyed to the ecstasy within me.“They would not regard my bones and blood; in spirit I am amighty king, even though in body I am vile.“What a ladder I, the Carpenter, have chiseled! My going hasreached the roof of the seventh heaven.  “I journeyed like the Messiah, my ass remained below; I donot grieve for my ass, nor am I asslike of ears. “Do not like Iblis see in Adam only water and clay; see thatbehind the clay are my hundred thousand rose bowers.”Shams-i Tabrlzl rose up from this flesh saying, “I am the sun.Bring up my head from this mire.“Err not, when I enter the mire once more, for I am at rest,and am ashamed of this veil.“Every morning I will rise up, despite the blind; for the sakeof the blind I will not cease to rise and set.”What hidden sweetness there is in this emptiness of the belly!Man is surely like a lute, no more and no less;For if, for instance, the belly of the lute becomes full, nolament high or low will arise from that full lute.If your brain and belly are on fire through fasting, because ofthe fire every moment a lament will arise from your breast.Every moment you will burn a thousand veils by that fire;you will mount a hundred steps with zeal and endeavor. Become empty of belly, and weep entreatingly like thereed pipe; become empty of belly, and tell secrets with thereed pen.If your belly is full at the time of concourse, it will bring Sa-tan in place of your reason, an idol in place of the Kaaba.When you keep the fast, good habits gather together beforeyou like slaves and servants and retinue.Keep the fast, for that is Solomon’s ring; give not the ring tothe dlv, destroy not your kingdom.Even if your kingdom has gone from your hand and yourarmy has fled, your army will rise up, pennants flying abovethem. The table arrived from heaven to the tents of the fast, by theintervention of the prayers of Jesus, son of Mary.  In the fast, be expectant of the table of bounty, tor the tableof bounty is better than the broth of cabbages.I have a fire for you in my mouth, but I have a hundred sealson my tongue.The flames which I have in my heart would make onemouthful of both worlds.Though the entire world should pass away, without theworld I possess the kingdom of a hundred worlds.Caravans which are loaded with sugar I have in motion forthe Egypt of nonexistence.The drunkenness oflove makes me unaware whether I haveprofit or loss therefrom.The body’s eye was scattering pearls because oflove, till nowI have a pearl-scattering soul.I am not housebound, for like Jesus I have a home in thefourth heaven.Thanks be to Him who gives soul to the body; if the soulshould depart, yet I have the soul of the soul.Seek from me that which Shams-i Tabrlzl has bestowed, for Ihave the same .By the God who was in pre-eternity living and knowing andomnipotent, everlasting,His light lit the candles oflove so that a hundred thousandsecrets became known.By one decree of Him the world was filled — lover and loved,ruler and ruled.In the talismans of Shams-i Tabriz! the treasure of His mar-vels became concealed.  For from the moment that you journeyed forth, we becameseparated from sweetness like wax;All the night we are burning like candles, paired to his flameand deprived of honey.In separation from his beauty my body is a waste, and thesoul in it is like an owl.Turn those reins in this direction, twist the trunk of theelephant of joy.Without your presence concert is not lawful; music has beenstoned like Satan.Without you not one ode has been uttered, until that gra-cious vision of yours arrived and was understood;Then out of the joy of hearing your letter five or six odeswere composed.May our eventide through you be radiant dawn, O you inwhom Syria and Armenia and Rum glory.Heart pure of breath and firm of foot, you came in order towarn the best of communities.Only at the direction of the heart you set your head like apen on the page of eternal love.In joy at your air and your justice we are dancing like apennant.Master, whither are you going, dancing? Towards liberationand the place of the plain of nonexistence.Master, say, which nonexistence in this? The ear of eternityknows the letter of eternity.Love is a stranger, and his tongue is strange, like that Arabstranger in Persia.Rise up, for I have brought you a tale; give ear to your ser-vant neither more nor less;Give ear to this strange speech; the tale is strange, and thespeaker too.  From the face of that Joseph the bottom of the well becamebright and happy as the Garden of Iram;That prison became a palace with orchards and meadows,Paradise, and a royal hall and vestibule of sanctity.As when you fling a clod into the water, the water that verymoment parts open;Like a night of cloud, when the sun of dawn suddenly putsup its head from the well of grief;Like the wine which the Bedouin drank and said, “God blessits jar and praise God”;Out of the joy of this imprisonment in humiliation and losshe Joseph looks upon the high-exalted heaven.Reason be not envious of my mouth; God has born witnessand counted the blessings.Though the tree drinks hidden water, there is clearly seen onits branches what it has concealed.Whatever the earth has stolen from heaven, it yields up mo-mently in the season of spring.Whether you have stolen a bead or a jewel, whether you havehoisted a flag or a pen,Night has departed, and lo, your day has arrived; the sleepershall see that which he has dreamed of.Stealthily as the soul, you are going in the midst of my soul;O luster of my garden, you are my gracefully moving cypress.When you go, go not without me; soul of my soul, go notwithout my body, and depart not out of my sight, O my blazingtorch.I tear up the seven heavens and pass beyond the seven seas,when lovingly you gaze into my giddy soul.Since you came into my bosom, infidelity and faith are myservitors, O you whose vision is my religion, whose face is myfaith.  You have made me headless and footless, you have mademe sleepless and foodless; enter drunken and laughing, O myJoseph of Canaan.Through your grace I have become soul-like and have be-come hidden from myself, O you whose being has become hid-den in my hidden being.The rose rends its garment because of you, O you withwhom the narcissus’ eye is intoxicated, of whom the branchesare pregnant, O you my infinite garden.One moment you brand me, the next you draw me into thegarden; you draw me before the lamp so that my eyes may beopened.O soul before all souls, O mine before all mines, O momentbefore all moments, O my very own, O my very own!Our resting place is not earth; though the body crumbles,it matters not. My thought is not the skies, O you, union withwhom is my heaven.The grave of mariners is the sea forevermore; in the water oflife where is death, O you, my Sea, my Ocean?O you whose scent is in my sigh, whose sigh is my fellowtraveler, in the hope of my Emperor color and scent have be-come distraught with me .My soul, since like a mote in the air it has become separatedfrom all heaviness, why should it be without you, O origin ofmy four elements?O my king Salah al-DIn, you who know my way and see myway, you who are free of concern with my little dignity, loftierthan my potentiality.Lovers, lovers, it is time to migrate from the world; the drumof departure is reaching my spirit’s ear from heaven.See, the driver has arisen, the camel train is arrayed, he hasbegged us for quittance; caravaners, why are you asleep?   These sounds ahead and behind are the sounds of departureand the camel-bells; every moment a soul and a breath is settingoff into placelessness.From these inverted candles, from these indigo veils, thereissues a wondrous people that the things unseen may becomevisible. If heavy slumber fell upon you from this revolving sphere,alas for this light life! Beware of this heavy slumber!Heart, depart to the Sweetheart; friend, depart to the Friend;watchman, be wakeful — a watchman should not sleep.On every side are candles and torches, on every side noiseand tumult, tor tonight the pregnant world gives birth to theeternal world.You were clay and became heart, you were ignorant and be-came intelligent; he who has drawn you on so far will draw youbeyond this world.In drawing and drawing you his pains are delectable; hisflames are like water, do not frown thereon.io His business is to dwell in the soul, his business to break pen-itence vows; by his abundant contrivance these motes are trem-bling at heart.Laughing stock, jumping out of your hole as if to cry, “I amthe lord of the land,” how long will you jump? Bend your neck,or they will bend you like a bow.You sowed the seeds of deceit, you indulged in mockery, youdeemed God nonexistent; now look, you cuckold!Ass, you were apter for straw; a cauldron, you were betterblack; you were better at the bottom of the well, you disgraceto house and household!In me there is Another from whom these angers leap; if wa-ter scalds, it is through fire — realize this! I have no stone in my hand; I have no quarrel with anyone; Ideal harshly with none, for I am gay as a rose bower.My anger is therefore from that source, it is from the otherworld; this side a world, that side a world — I am seated on thethreshold.  That man sits on the threshold who is mutely eloquent; youhave uttered this hint, that is enough; say no more, draw backyour tongue.O gardener, gardener, autumn has come, autumn has come;see on branch and leaf the mark, see the mark of heart-anguish.O gardener, attend, give ear, hearken to the lament of thetrees; on every side a hundred tongueless ones, a hundredtongueless ones bewailing.Never without cause are eyes weeping and lips parched; noone without heart-anguish is pale of cheek, pale of cheek.In short, the raven of grief has entered the garden and isstamping his feet, demanding in mockery and oppression,“Where is the rose bower, where is the rose bower?“Where is lily and eglantine? Where cypress and tulip and jas-mine? Where the green- garmented ones of the meadow? Wherethe Judas tree, where the Judas tree?“Where are the nurses of the fruits? Where the gratis honeyand sugar? Every breast, every breast is dry of this flowing milk.“Where is my sweet- voiced nightingale? Where is my cooingringdove? Where is the peacock fair as an idol? Where are theparrots, where are the parrots?”Like Adam having eaten a grain fallen from his abode, theircrown and fine robes have flown from this dazzling array, thisdazzling array.The rose bower constrained like Adam, alike lamenting andexpectant, since the Lord of Bounty said to them, “Do not de-spair.”All the trees drawn up in ranks, black-robed, plunged inmourning, leafless and sad and lamenting because of that trial.O crane and lord of the village, at last return some answer;“Have you gone into the depths or departed to heaven, toheaven?”  They replied, “Enemy raven, that water shall return to thestreams, the world will become full of scent even as Paradise,even as Paradise.”O babbling raven, be patient three months more, till therearrive despite you the festival of the world, the festival of theworld.Through the voice of our Seraphiel our lantern will becomebright, we shall become alive from the death of that autumnfestival, that autumn festival.How long this denial and doubt? Behold the mine of joy andsalt; fly to heaven like a manikin without a ladder, without aladder!The beastlike autumn dies, you stamp upon its grave; lo, thedawn of fortune is breaking, O watchman, watchman!O dawn, fill the world with light, drive afar these Hindus ofthe night, set free the time, recite a spell, recite a spell! sweet-working sun, return to Aries, leave neither ice normud, scattering ambergris, scattering ambergris.Fill the rose bower with laughter, bring to life those deadones, make shining the concourse; ha, see what comes tosight.The seeds are escaped from prison, we too from the cornerof our houses; the garden out of hidden places has brought ahundred presents, a hundred presents.The rose bower fills with beauties, fur coats are a drug on themarket, the cycle of time, the cycle of time is giving birth andgenerating.The crane is coming with his drooping wings over the palace,tall as the sky, babbling as if to say, “Yours is the kingdom, Orefuge in need, O refuge in need!”The nightingale enters playing the lute, and that dove coo-ing, the other birds celebrate with song, youthful fortune,youthful fortune. am pregnant with this resurrection; I abandon the speechof the tongue; the thoughts of my heart come not into thetongue, into the tongue.  Silence! Listen, father, to the news from garden and birds:flying arrowlike they have come from placelessness, from place-lessness.Enough now from the cry dush — “dismount” — I haveremained far from my road; enough from the cry qush — “setoff” — I have missed my tent.When will you deliver me from this qushi When will youdeliver me from this dush , that I may arrive at your prosperity,at my moon and threshing floor?Though I am happy on the journey over plain and moun-tain and valley, in your love, O sun of splendor, timely and un-timely,Yet where is the broad highway? Where is the sight and jus-tice of the king? Especially for me, consumed in yearning for myking.EIow long must I ask news of you from the zephyr? Howlong must I seek your moon’s image in the water of my well?I have been burnt up a hundred ways like the garden, andlikewise I have learned from spring — in both states I am dumb-founded at the handiwork of my God.I become not satiated with you — this is my only sin; benot satiated with compassion for me, O my refuge in bothworlds!Satiated and weary of me have become his jar, and water-carrier and waterskin; every moment my water-seeking fish be-comes thirstier.Break the pitcher, tear up the waterskin, I am going towardsthe sea; make clear my road.  How long will the earth become mire from my teardrops?How long will the sky be darkened by the grief and smoke ofmy sighs?How long will my heart lament, “Alas, my heart, my ruinedheart?” How long will my lips wail before the phantom of myking?Go towards the sea from which the wave of delight is com-ing; behold how my house and hospice are drowned in its wave.Last night the water of life surged from the courtyard of myhouse; my Joseph yesterday fell like the moon into my well.Suddenly the torrent came and swept all my harvest away;smoke mounted from my heart, my grain and chaff were con-sumed.Though my harvest is gone, I will not grieve; why should Igrieve? The halo of the light of my moon is more than enoughfor a hundred like me.He entered my heart; his image was of fire. The fire rose overmy head; my cap was consumed.He said, “Concerts impair dignity and respect.” You canhave dignity, for His love is my luck and dignity.I desire not intellect and wisdom; his learning is enough forme. The light of his cheek at midnight is the blaze of my dawn.The army of sorrow is mustering; I will not grieve at his armybecause my horses, squadron on squadron, have seized evenheaven.After every ode my heart repents of discoursing; the sum-mons of my God waylays my heart.If any man asks you about the houris, show your face, saying,“Like this”; if any man speaks to you of the moon, get up ontothe roof — “Like this.”If any seeks a peri, show him your countenance; if any men-tions musk, open your tresses — “Like this.”  If any says to you, “How does cloud disclose the moon?,”loosen knot by knot the strings of your gown — “Like this.”If one asks you how the Messiah revived the dead, beforehim kiss me on the lips — “Like this.”If any says to you, “Say, how is he who is slain of love?” ex-hibit to him my soul — “Like this.”If any asks you compassionately about my stature, exhibityour own brow folded double — “Like this.”The soul is separated from the body, and thereafter re-turns again; ho, show to those who disbelieve, enter thehouse — “Like this.”Whenever you hear a lover’s lament, by God’s right, all thatis our story — “Like this.”I am the home of every angel, I am the black and blue beatenchest; raise your eyes and look well at heaven — “Like this.”To none but the zephyr have I told the secret of union withthe Beloved, so that the zephyr said in the joy of its secretheart — “Like this.”Despite him who says, “How shall the servant attain God?”put in the hand of every one a bright candle — “Like this.”I said, “How does the scent of Joseph travel from city tocity?” The scent of God breathed from the world of Hu — “Likethis.”I said, “How does the scent of a Joseph give back sight?”Your breeze irradiated my eyes — “Like this.”From Tabriz haply Shams-i Din will be benevolent, and outof his grace in fidelity lift up his head — “Like this.”Lord, would that I knew what is the desire of my Beloved;He has barred my road of escape, robbed me of my heart andmy repose.Lord, would that I knew whither He is dragging me, to whatpurpose He is dragging my toggle in every direction.  Lord, would that I knew why He is stonyhearted, that lovingKing of mine, my long-suffering Darling.Lord, would that I knew whether my sighing and my clamor,“My Lord and my defense!” — will reach my Beloved at all. Lord, would that I knew where this will end; Lord, this mynight of waiting is very long.Lord, what is this ferment of mine, all this bashfulness ofmine? — Seeing that you are mine, you are at once my one andmy thousand.Your love is always both silent and eloquent before the imageof my eye, my sustenance and my fate!Now I call him quarry, now I call him spring, now I nick-name him wine, now my crop sickness.He is my unbelief and faith, my light-beholding eye, that ofmine and this of mine — I cannot escape from him.io No more patience has remained for me, nor sleep, nor tearsnor water; Lord, how long will he raid all the four of mine?Where is the house of water and clay, compared with that ofsoul and heart? Lord, my sole desire has become my hometownand habitation.This heart is banished from the town, stuck in dark mire,lamenting, “O God, where is my family and retinue?”Lord, if only I might reach my city and behold the compas-sion of my prince, and all that city of my friend!Gone then my hard road, the heavy load from my back; mylong-suffering Darling would come, carrying off my load. My lion-catching deer would drink to the full of my milk, hewhose quarry I am would have become my quarry.Blaclc-faced night is then not the mate and consort of myday; stonyhearted autumn follows not in the wake of myspringtide .Will you not be silent? How long will you beat this drum?Alas, my veiled lip, that you have become veil-rending!  Suddenly today the enemy of my penitence and patienceapproached me midway on the road and cherished me like aking.Seizing a cup like any drunkard, in it a hundred blandish-ments and charms, he held before me the wine cup, saying, “Ifyou are a winebibber, take.”Illumined as the face of Moses, blessed as Mount Sinai,gleaming as the White Hand, dilated with joy as the heartof ‘Imran.Ho, come take this clean tablet from this Moses; be not arro-gant like Pharaoh, contend not like Haman. I said to him, “Moses, what is in your hand?” He said, “Onetime this is a staff, one time a serpent.“From every separate atom a hundred various shapes appear;for whatever is necessary for Bu Huraira is in the bag.“In my hand is the control of it, I change it into every form;I make poison into medicine, I make the difficult easy.“Now I strike it on the sea and bring up dust from the sea;now I strike it on the rock and the fountain of life gushes out.“Now I showed the limpid water of the Nile to the enemy asblood, to the common folk I showed stone and earth as pearland coral.io “To the eye of the envious I am the wolf; to Jacob himself,Jospeh; to the ignorant, Bu Jahl; Muhammad, before him whoknows God.”Sweet- breathed rosewater is death and asphyxiation to theblack beetle; sugary syrup is fatal to the bilious.Apparently all seekers are fellow travelers; in reality they areback to back. One has made his lodging in the lowest depths,the other in the highest heaven.Like a child and an old man, though apparently fellow travel-ers, one is increasing every day, the other every moment on thedecline. ? What a cup of poison and candy is this! What magic and jug-glery! This turn and this revolution keep you giddy.The world is fixed and you see it as revolving; when a man’shead is spinning, he sees the house as spinning.Know as a station of fear that in which you are secure; knowas a station of security that in which you tremble.Since you are contrary and false you see everything contrari-wise; foolish man, when you consult a woman, oppose her!That one is a woman whose road and qibla is color and scent;truly woman is the evil-commanding soul in human form.The counsel of the spiritual is like the buzzing of bees;from its lip it fills the floor of the house to the attic with itssweets.Bravo the incomprehensible comprehended, bravo the fa-miliar stranger, bravo the sourness better than sweet, bravo theunbelief better than faith!Be silent, for the tongue has become a door keeper frommeasuring words; when the heart speaks without words, it oc-cupies the high throne like a king.Shine, Shams-i Tabriz!, upon the Houses of the heart, tor thesun of a secure seat is not like this spinning sun.My world-illuminating lamp is not shining so brightly;strange — is this the fault of the eye, or the light, or the window?Has perchance the end of the thread become lost? What hasbecome of that past state? In that state the tip of the needledoes not remain hidden.Happy the moment when the farrash of “we spread” withinthis mosque pours oil from the olive of God into this lantern ofthe heart!Heart, enter the crucible of fire, sit there quietly like a man,for through the influence of this fire the iron became such amirror.  When Abraham entered the flames like gold coin, theregrew from the face of the fire a jasminebed and roses andlilies.If you do not bring your heart out of this tumult into thispassion, what will you do with this heart? Come, sit here andtell me.If out of unmanliness you do not enter the ring of true men,be outside like a ring on men’s door and knock.Since the prophet said “Fasting is a protection,” lay holdof that, do not cast away this shield before the arrow-shootingcarnal soul.On this dry land a shield is necessary; when you reach thesea, then there will grow on your body a coat of mail like a fishto repel his shafts.It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon one another, tofight and squabble and make tumult.The lover is worse then the drunkard; the lover also be-longs to that party. I will tell what love is; it is to fall into agoldmine.What may that gold be? The lover is the king of kings; itmeans becoming secure from death and not caring for thegolden crown.The darvish in his cloak, and in his pocket the pearl — whyshould he be ashamed of begging from door to door? Last night that moon came along, having flung his girdle onthe road, so drunken that he was not aware that his girdle hadfallen.I said, “Leap up, my heart, place wine in the hand of thesoul; for such a time has befallen, it is time to be roistering,“To become hand in hand with the garden nightingale, tofall into sugar with the spiritual parrot.”  I, heart-forlorn and heart -yielded, fallen upon your way — byAllah, I know of no other place to fall.If I broke your bowl, I am drunk, my idol. I am drunk —leave me not from your hand to fall into danger.This is a newborn rule, a newly enacted decree — to shatterglasses, and to fall upon the glassmaker!Go, know that the code of lovers is opposite to all otherways, for from the Beloved lies are better than truth andbeneficence .His impossibility comes to pass, his insalubriousness isa bonus, his injustice is all rectitude. Calumny from him isjustice.His hard is soft, his synagogue is the Kaaba, the Beloved’sthorn is better than roses and basil.The moment when he is bitter is better than a sweetshop,and the moment when he becomes weary, that is kissing andembracing.The moment when he says to you, “By Allah, I am indifferentto you” — that is the water of Khidar from the fountain of life.The moment when he says “No,” in his “No” are a thousand“Yeses”; his strangerhood is kinship according to the code ofthe unselfed.His infidelity becomes all faith, his stone all coral, his miser-liness all beneficence, his crime all forgiveness.If you criticize, you say, “You have a crooked way of goingon”; I have bought the way of his brow and given my life.I am drunk with this crooked way; I have made enough, andclosed my lips — rise up, bright heart, and recite the rest of it.Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz!! Dear Lord, what sugar you sprin-kle! You might say that out of my mouth proceed a hundredproofs and demonstrations.  Become placeless in the Unity, make your place in theessence of annihilation; every head which possesses duality puton a Christian neck.In the cage of being, before this bird of sanctity flies on thewing, make it sugar-cracking in thankfulness.Since you were drunk in pre-eternity, seize the sword ofpost-eternity, like a Turk plunder the Hindu-Bay of existence.Filter and purify the dregs of your separate being, and fillthat glass of true reality with pure wine.

Snake, when you have become a fish, then charge intothe sea.Observe the beast, how it holds its head towards the earth; ifyou are a man, why then, lift your head towards the heights.When in Adam’s school you have become intimate withGod, sit on the high throne of the King and teach the Names.If you desire the kingship of ilia, proceed first to la; seize thebroom from la and become a sweeper of things.If you intend to journey, go on the mount of meaning, andif it be so that you take up residence, let it be in the green domeof heaven.io Be like the sufferer from dropsy who is never satiated; how-ever high you get, strive to rise still higher.Every spirit that has an aim keeps his face to the door; youaim at this madness, so turn your head towards madness.The body is not without a shadow, and the shadow cannotbe bright; fly towards the window and make your flight unac-companied.Following Majnun’s rule, be an agent of turmoil, for thislove is declaring, “Make yourself quit of reason!”Become at once a burning fire, and become roasted and well-browned; become at once drunk and wine, seize fast withouteither.  Become at once secretive and intimate, be silent and becomecompanion; at once become us and become ours, likewise beservant to us.Lest the Christian should steal into your monastery, now bea lover of the girdle, now aim at the cross.You have become learned, but only in existential learning; gowithout existential eyes, make your eyes see.A moses with the character of Khidar, Shams al-Haqq-iTabriz! — lay your head at his toot, seek the White Hand.Come, how much is a kiss from that precious ruby? If a kiss isfor a life, it is a duty to buy.Since the kiss is pure and not proper to earth, I will become adisengaged spirit, I will emerge from this body.The sea of purity said to me, “No aspiration is granted gratis;the pearl of price is with you — come, break the shell.”For a kiss of the rose, which confers splendor on wine, thewhole world is putting out its tongue like a lily.I blunder, if you be all kings, if you be like Mars and themoon, ask not for a kiss from that untamed Darling.Enter, moon of heaven, for I have opened the window; forone night shine on my face, press your lips on mine.Close the door of speech and open the heart’s window;you will not obtain a kiss of this moon save by way of thewindow.A call came to the soul from the sphere of the Pleiades:“Come up, do not sit below like the dregs.”No one remains so long on a journey apart from his home-land and former friends.  Well, you have heard the call, Return from that king andsweet emperor.In this ruined waste owls are dwelling; what habitation haveyou fashioned, poor falcon? What rest does he get, on whichever side he turns, whomakes his mattress of thorns?What bond is there between money-changer and counter-feiter? What relation is there between crow and falcon?Why do you adorn with plaster a ruin which above is coveredwith paintings and beneath is a prison?Why do you not adorn your soul with wisdom?

Look at the tombs beneath the bricks, tor you cannot tellapart their heads from their foundations.O God, bring my soul safely to the souls by that road onwhich the family of Yasin went;Mingle our prayers with theirs, so that from us comes theprayer and from Thee the amen.Grant that thy grace and loving kindness may be such that,as little as our good works may be, from Thee comes the “Welldone.”Bring us safely from lustfulness to reasonableness, unto thezenith above from this lower abode .  Whither would you fly from my clutch? Who knows how torend the net of omnipotence?Since you have not the foot to flee from me, bend down yourneck, have done with obstinacy.Run towards sweetness like unripe grapes, if you know nothow to run inwardly.Caught in the net you are biting the rope; this rope shall notbe broken by biting. Do you not see how your head is in my bowstring? You are abow, you must bend to the string.Why do you kick up your hind legs saying, “I have escapedthe load?” I have merely let you go for a moment to graze.In fear and awe of me the sea’s heart surges with billows andthrobbing.If the rocky mountain should encounter that blow, it wouldnot be able to leap out of my chains.Until my command says to heaven, “Enough,” it must go onspinning around my earth.io Desire is a milk from the teats of Satan; your reason is to suckasses’ milk.Earth’s mouth is dry out of despair for me, without me itcannot swallow a single mouthful.Who is able to attack my quarry? Who is able to purchase myslave?He whom I have seized and chosen, whom shall he chooseother than me?The soul has no security save in love; it is necessary to creepamongst lovers. Lovers have security in both worlds; even so they were at thetime of creation.It behooves not the sheep to scatter away from the shepherdtowards the wolves because the shepherd is cruel.  This shepherd will not shed the blood of the sheep, tor heknows to rear them to eternal life.Know that the companions of the body are the Companionsof the Elephant; how can such ever reach the Kaaba?For the Kaaba is the world’s navel, the elephant is the nose; itis not possible to draw the nose to the navel.

Shams al-DTn-i Tabriz! is the heart of hearts; the bat is unableto see the sun.See how every particle of the world is passing by, see howeveryone has arrived from a journey;See how everyone desirous of his own sustenance has bowedhis head before his king.See how, like the stars, for the sake of its glow, are all fallenhelpless at the foot of the sun;See how, like torrents in quest of water, all are tumblingheadlong towards their sea. See how for each from the king’s kitchen a table is preparedaccording to his needs.See how the sea of the world is contracted before their sea-drinking cup.And as for those whose sustenance is the king’s countenance,see how their mouths are filled with sugar of the king’s beauty.  Behold with the eyes of Shams-i Tabnzi, see another oceanfilled with pearls.This is love: to fly to heaven, every moment to rend a hun-dred veils;At first instance, to break away from breath — first step, torenounce feet;To disregard this world, to see only that which you yourselfhave seen.I said, “Heart, congratulations on entering the circle of lovers,“On gazing beyond the range of the eye, on running intothe alley of the breasts.”Whence came this breath, O heart? Whence came this throb-bing, O heart?Bird, speak the tongue of birds: I can heed your cipher!The heart said, “I was in the factory whilst the home of waterand clay was abaking.“I was flying from the workshop whilst the workshop wasbeing created.“When I could no more resist, they dragged me; how shall Itell the manner of that dragging?”That enemy of soul and mind and faith has returned, shakinghis sleeves —Plunderer of a hundred thousand houses, devastator of ahundred thousand shops,Stirrer-up of a hundred thousand tumults, amazement-locusof a hundred thousand amazed ones,That nurse of reason and bane of reason, that friend of thesoul and enemy of the soul.  Whither will he transport my light reason? He seeks a reasonlike that of Luqman.How does he accept my worthless soul? He seeks a soul likethe sea of Oman.He came, saying, “Bring the tribute of the village!” I said,“What village? It is a ruined village.“Your flood has shattered cities; how shall a village standamid the flood?”He said, “Ruins are the abode of treasures; it is our ruin, OMuslim!“Give us the ruin, or go forth; do not upbraid, do not speakat random.”The ruin is of yourself; once you have gone it thrives throughthe justice of the King.Do not dissemble and say I have gone; do not hide behindthe door.Make yourself as one dead, that you may become living bythe spirit of a man.You said, “You shall not be in the midst”; that saying ofyours is the essence of Koran.The work you do, yourself not in the midst, that is workdone by God — know this for sure.I will recite the rest of the poem in secret; it cannot be toldbefore the uninitiated.Silence! For there are a hundred thousand differences be-tween the tongue’s utterance and the light of revelation.Do not grieve over any joy that has gone forever, for it willreturn to you in another form, know that for sure.Did not the child find joy in its nursing and in milk? Whenthe child was weaned from milk, the joy came from wine andhoney.This joy is an unqualified thing which enters various forms,moves from box to box between water and clay;It suddenly displays its grace in the water of the rain, againenters into the rosebed, and lifts its head from the earth.Now it comes by water, now by way of bread and meat, nowby way of beauty, now by way of horse and saddle.From behind these veils suddenly one day it peeps and shat-ters all the idols, that which is neither that nor this.The soul in sleep leaves the body and appears in a phantasm;the body is deposed and idle — in another form it is manifest.You might say, “In a dream I saw myself like a cypress, myface as a bed of tulips, my body as roses and jasmine.”That phantasm of the cypress vanished, the soul returned toits house; verily in this and that is a warning to all beings.I fear stirring up trouble, though I would have spoken whatmay be spoken, God speaks fairer than I — do not let go of thesaddlestraps of the faith.Fa Hldtun fa Hldtunfd ‘ildtun fa e ildt, if you have not gold-wheat bread, yet speak the golden words.At last, Tabriz of the soul, look upon the stars of the heart,that you may see this mundane sun to be a reflection of Shams-eDin.My king of moonfaced ones went up to his sick lovers, say-ing, “O pale cheeks and saffronbed of mine!“I will water my saffronbed, I will convert the saffron toroses with my fountain of life.“Yellow and red, thorn and rose are at my control and com-mand; set not your head save on the line of my command, mycommand!“The world’s rosefaced ones have stolen beauty from mybeauty; they have stolen an atom of my beauty and beneficence.l>  “In the end these moonfaced ones are becoming strawfaced;that is the state of thieves in the presence of my King.”Day has come; earthly ones, restore the stolen goods. O mysoul, whence come goods for earthly man, and whence beauty?When at night the sun has vanished, the stars make boast.Venus says, “Know it is mine”; the moon says, “No, mine.”Jupiter produces Ja‘far gold from his purse; Mars says toSaturn, “See my cutting dagger!”Mercury takes the high seat — “I am the Sadr al-Sudur, theheavens are my kingdom, the zodiacs are my pillars!”io With dawn the sun draws up his army from the east saying,“Thieves, where have you gone? See, it is mine!”Venus is terrified, the moon’s neck is broken; Mercury hasbecome dry and cold with my shining face.The business of Mars and Saturn is ruined by our light;Jupiter is bankrupt, saying, “Alas, my purse is gone!”When the sun had run afield, came a cry, “Ho, mannerlessone, get out of my field!“I am the sun of the sun: sun, depart! Sink into the well ofthe west: enter my prison. “At dawn lift your head from the {grave} of the east and cometo life; make the deniers of the resurrection aware of my proof.“Every man’s festival is the month moon to which he isa sacrifice; your festival is my month moon, you who are asacrifice to me!”When Shams-i Tabrlzl shone from the House of not-of-the-East, the glow of his essence surpassed my bounds and poten-tialities.The intellectual is all the time engaged in showing off; thelover is all the time becoming unselfed and distraught;Intellectuals are running away, afraid of drowning; the wholebusiness and trade oflovers is drowning in the sea.  +  Intellectuals find repose by contriving repose; lovers think ita shame to be attached to repose.The lover will be in a circle, alone from everyone, just as oiland water, though in the same place, are separate. The man who goes to the trouble of offering advice to loversgets nothing for his pains but to be a mockery of passion.Love has the scent of musk, it is therefore notorious; howcan musk escape from such notoriety?Love is like a tree, and lovers are the shade of that tree;though the shade fall afar, yet it must attend the tree.For the station of intellect a child must become an old man;in the station of love you see an old man become youthful.Shams-i TabrizI, whoever has chosen to be lowly in love foryou, thereby rises to heights sublime as your love.Saki, now that you are drunk, fling yourself on me; to recol-lect tomorrow is credit — smite the neck of credit.The year is our year, and the ascendant is the ascendant ofVenus and the moon; O heart, this pleasure and joy has nobounds — be at rest.Glow and gaiety have penetrated to the heart of stone andsteel; if you do not believe, strike the stone upon the steel.Look at the host, see the happiness upon his face; sit at thistable and dip your bowl in the oil. Summon up nimble reason and seat it beside happiness;jovially apply your bright soul to bright wine.The branches are drunk and dancing in the wind of spring;jasmine, be drunk, and cypress, stroke the lily.They have cut green garments at the shop of the unseen;tailor, rise up, sit at your shop, stick in your needle. What light is that in the midst of the darkness of your soul?A royal splendor is shining in my heart — who is that?It appears that it is the fantasy of the king’s moonlike face,that it is the succoring shelter of the day of misery.All this splendor and beauty and grace and loveliness andcharm is the Pride of Souls, Shams-i Haqq-i Dln-i Tabriz!.The human soul cannot endure the clear exposition of hisqualities; all that it can endure of his qualities, my heart, is byallusion.For how should eternal qualities display themselves in mor-tality to a mixture which itself is of the mortal world?How far does that beauty, which God engraved of His ownhand, transcend an image created by Azar or Mam!The eye that has beheld him, and then looked on anotherthan him, must be stoned, lor it is worthless.O heart, in loverhood abandon your good name, for thebeginning of love is notoriety and evil fame.In the sea of his love the soul’s clothes are an embarrassment;to seek in love lor name and bread is rawness, my heart.Even the love of the generality of people has this specialty,my heart; all the more especially this love which belongs to thatlofty assembly.Zephyr, bring the earth of Tabriz as a present tor my sake,tor in preciousness it compares with a jewel of the quarry.Lover, open your two eyes and behold in yourself tourstreams — a stream of water, a stream of wine, streams of milkand honey.Lover, look into yourself, do not be a laughingstock of men,so that So-and-so says this, and So-and-so says that.  I am the slave of that all-seeing rose which is indifferentwhether So-and-so calls it thorn, or So-and-so calls it jasmine.Then open your eyes henceforward, walk not with the eyesof men, that So-and-so says you are a Guebre and So-and-so aman of true religion.God of his generosity gave you the eye of vision, to whoselanguidness the pinion of Gabriel prostrates.Bandage not the narcissus-eye, and take not the vulture-eye;bandage not the first eye, and look not with the squint-eye.Lovers of form have fallen into form, like the fly which fallsfrom honey into a vat of whey.Rejoice, you who play at love with the eternal Almighty; withsuch wings, why should you sorrow over water and clay?If you desire that Gabriel should become your slave, begone; prostrate before Adam at once, accursed div\If the blood-drinking desert had knowledge of my Kaaba, onall sides a rose bower would appear, on all sides springwater.You who continue to regard the evil and good of people,how is it you have become content with that? May the Lordhelp you!Since heaven itself had not the strength to bear God’s trust,how is it that Shams-i Tabriz! has diffused it in the earth?By God, I have no inclination towards either fat or sweet,nor for the purse full of gold, neither for the golden cup.You draw the people of earth to heaven; the moon ex-claims, “What grace and generosity! What amazing power andauthority!”When your fantasy shines on me like the moon at the full,Venus and the Pleiades bite their forearms and fingers in envy.Ha, thanks be to God that I have attained this kingdom;it was all true, what your love said to me again and againof old.   When he saw me on tiptoe, he signaled to me saying, “Whatyou desire has come to pass; ho, be secure and be seated!”All creatures in intoxication of joy bow down before him;lamb and wolf are friendly together, no envy or hatred in theheart;They are so drunk they cannot tell the way to town from theway home; they know not “whether we are men, extraordinary,or colored clay.”Goblet in hand and distraught, I wonder what am I to dowith this? Drink it or bestow it? You tell me, sweet king!“You drink; what bestowing should there be? For your turnhas come.” Lo, I have drunk; lo, I have drunk, since I am speci-fied before you.io “Drink this wine of the throne, whereof if you were to placeone cup in the hand of a dead man, he would respond to theprompting.”Beautiful one, by your roguish eye, signal with your eye; forone moment repair with a glance this your ruin.Heart and soul, martyrs to your love, in the tomb of thebody — pass along by the tomb of those martyrs, pay a pilgrim-age.You are come like a Joseph, all Egypt has cut its hands; dis-play your charm and take my heart and soul, do a deal!Or if you have stamped your foot tyrannically and sworn avow, then break your vow — what matter? Do expiation. Say not, “What profit shall I have from this offering ofyours?” You need not profit; give, and take a loss!Convert this saffronlike cheek into the like of roses andanemones; make a rejoicing heart out of three or four dropsof blood.Since fortune is your slave, it will never rebel against you;king, be an ambassador between us and fortune.  Since sins are as a straw before the mountain of yourclemency, look with disdain upon our mountain of sins.Our body was two drops of blood that became pure and hu-man; you also cleanse the impure quality.Since souls here become the prisoner of water and clay fromthe world of the spirit, deliver them from the clay, Abode ofWar, and make a raid!Since I have repented of words, for the sake of the disciplesinstead of words issue a meaningful signal and command.This firelike breath is for the sake of making warm; make aglow other than your breath a source of heat.You who are King Shams-i Din, by the shining manifestationof yourself, make lovely Tabriz the abode of vision.Since you deserted me death is for me joy and ease; withoutyou, death has become for me like honey and milk.The waterless fish quivers on that rough sand until its feeblesoul may become parted from its body.For the living ones, the water oflife has become the waterof bitterness; pure sugar has become worse for them than thegrave and winding-sheet.It is no mere game, the drawing of the part to the origin, theAll; how often the prophet wept for love of his homeland!The child who does not know his homeland and birthplacedesires a nurse; Istanbul or Yemen — they are all one to him.The star goes to graze in the pasture of the skies; the animalworships earth, like cypress and jasmine.Though I close my mouth to silence this lamentation, it isnot possible to close one’s mouth in the belly of the water.The frog’s breath is of water, not of the wind of the air; thisis the custom and craft of sea creatures.Gnostics who are hidden in that ocean oflight, their breathis all of darkness-shattering light.  When I reached this point, my pen and tablet broke; themountain is shattered when it becomes aware of the Lord ofGrace .All have eaten and fallen asleep, and the house has becomeempty; it is time tor us to saunter forth to the garden,To draw the skirt of the apple towards the peach, to carry afew words from the dewy rose to the jasmine.Springtide is like the Messiah, it is all art, a spell, that theplant-martyrs may arise from their winding-sheets.Since those fair idols opened their mouths in gratitude,the soul not attaining a kiss is drunk with the perfume of theirmouths.The glow on the cheeks of rose and tulip informs me thatthere is a lamp hidden in this place under the screen.The leaf trembles on the twig, and my heart is trembling; theleaf trembles in the wind, my heart for the beauty of Khotan.The hand of the zephyr has fanned the censor till it taughtgood manners to the children of the garden.The breath of the Holy Spirit has encountered the trees ofMary; see how husband and wife are playing with hands to-gether in joy .The cloud, seeing the lovely ones beneath the canopy, scat-tered over them jewels and pearls of Aden.Now that the red rose in joy has rent its skirt, the time hascome for the shirt to reach Jacob.Since the Yemeni carnelian of the Beloved’s lips laughed, thescent of God reaches Muhammad from Yemen.We have spoken much at random, and our heart has notfound repose save upon that scattered tress of the King of thetime.  Wherever you set your toot, my darling, tulip and violet andjasmine spring up.You breathe upon a piece of clay, and it becomes either adove or a kite.You wash your hands in a dish and from the water of yourhand that basin becomes of gold.You recite the Fdtiha over a grave and a Bu’l-Futuh raises hishead from the winding-sheet.Your skirt strikes against the clutch of a thorn, and its clutchbecomes a strumming lute.Every idol you have broken, O Abraham, receives life andfinds intellect from that breaking.Since the new moon shone upon an evil-starred one, itbecame the greatest good fortune and he escaped from mis-fortune.Every moment there springs from the court of your breast anewborn without mother or father, like Adam.And thereafter from his side and loins children abound in theearth.I wanted to speak fifty couplets on this rhyme; I closed mylips, that you might open your mouth.Elear the wordless subtleties, and understand what catchesnot the understanding.Inside the stonelike heart of man is a fire which burns up theveil, root and branch;When the veil is burnt he discovers all the stories of Khidarand the knowledge from us.Between the soul and the heart appears new and ever newforms from the ancient love.  When you recite By the sun behold the sun! Behold the mineof gold when you recite Bam yakon.Last night I saw Poverty in a dream, I became beside myselffrom its beauty.From the loveliness and perfection of the grace of poverty Iwas dumbfounded until dawn.I saw poverty like a mine of ruby, so that through its hue Ibecame clothed in silk.I heard the clamorous rapture of lovers, I heard the cry of“Drink now, drink!” I saw a ring all drunken with poverty; I saw its ring in myown ear.I saw many forms in the light of poverty, I saw many a formof the soul in its face.From the midst of my soul a hundred surgings rose when Ibeheld the surging of the sea.Heaven uttered a hundred thousand cries; I am the slave ofsuch a leader.Though long enough I have sat in fire up to my neck, now Iam up to my neck in the water of union with the Beloved.I said, “I am immersed in your graces up to my neck.” TheDarling was not content with me up to the neck.He said, “Make your head a foot, descend into the depthsoflove, for this affair does not come out right only up to theneck.”I said, “My head, Beloved, is your shoe; only be content, mytwo eyes, with up to my neck this time.”  He said, “You are less than a thorn which was up to the neckin earth tor nine months waiting tor the rose.”I said, “What is the thorn? For the sake of your rosebed Ihave sat often in blood up to my neck like the rose.”He said, “Through love you have escaped from the world ofallurement, where you were struggling impotently up to yourneck.“You escaped from the world, but not from yourself; yourself-existence is a disgrace, and this disgrace is up to your neck.“Lay not traps cunningly, give up trickery; the trickmasterremains in his own trap up to the neck.“The trap of this world is a trap through which kings andlions have remained like dogs in the carrion up to the neck.“There is a stranger trap than this, through which you maysee the reasonless fallen up to the ankle, the prudent up to theneck.”Enough of speech, now that breath is cut off; after all, speechdoes not reach up to the neck from choking.Go, lay your head on the pillow, let me alone; leave me ru-ined and night-faring and afflicted as I am.I am wrestling with the wave of passion alone through nighttill day; if you will, come and have mercy; if you will, go and becruel.Flee from me that you too may not fall into calamity; choosethe path of safety, leave the path of calamity.We with our tears flowing have crept in the corner of grief;turn the mill a hundred times upon our tears.A tyrant we have who has a heart like flint; he slays, and noone says to him, “Prepare to pay the blood-money.”To the king of the lovely ones faithfulness is not obligatory;pale lover, you endure, be faithful.  This is a pain of which no cure exists but to die, so how shallI say, “Cure this pain?”Last night in a dream I saw an elder in the quarter of love : hebeckoned to me with his hand, saying, “Set out towards me.”If a dragon is on the path, love is like an emerald; with theflash of this emerald repel the dragon.Enough, for I am beside myself, if you would be a man ofsuperior learning, recite the history of Bu ‘All, and admonishBud-Ala.Did you see what January said? Lay brushwood like a stack: ifDecember brought not cold, the cold of both be on me.Since the cold has become stubborn, lay brushwood on thefire. Do you spare brushwood? Is brushwood better, or thebody?Brushwood is the fleeting form, God’s love is the fire: burnup the forms, O pure-skirted soul!Until you burn up the form, your spirit will be frozen, likeidol worshipers far from springtime and security.In firelike love, be happy like silver; since you are a child ofAbraham, fire is your dwelling.By God’s command, fire becomes for true men tulip androse, clusters of basil, willow and lily.The believer knows the spell and recites it over the fire; theheat remains in it no more, it remains shining as the moon.Blessed be the spell through which peace befalls in a firewhich can transform iron into needle.The moth flings itself upon the kindled fire because the firereveals itself lit in the shape of a window.To Hamza arrow and spear appear as scattering roses; in ascatter of roses no man clothes himself in armor.Pharaoh was dissolved in the water like whey; Moses sat onthe brow of the water like oil.  Horses of spirit are the carriers of princes; dull and sluggishhorses carry packs and dung.Speech is like a hopper on the mill of meaning; the mill turnsby water, not by regulating the hopper.From that hopper, my brother, the wheat leaps from thebucket and falls in the mill and becomes well and truly ground. So from that hopper of expression, out of the bucket ofgreed and negligence, you fall into the mill, that is in a clearlyexpressed way.My soul, I am becoming hot, but not from chatter; it is fromthe golden Sun of the Faith, from whom Tabriz is like a mine.Sit with lovers, altogether choose loverhood; be not tor amoment companion with him who is not a lover.And if it be that the Beloved has drawn the curtain of allmight, go, gaze on the face of him who is not veiled;Behold that face on whose cheeks are the marks of His face;contemplate him on whose brow shines the sun.Inasmuch as the sun has laid his two cheeks on his cheeks,through his cheeks the moon on earth is checkmated. In his tresses is the copy of Thee we serve; in his eyes theglance in Thee we beg for succor.His body, like the body of a phantom, is without blood andveins; inside and outside it is all milk and honey.Inasmuch as the Beautiful takes him into his embrace, he hascarried away the scent of the Beloved and let go the scent of clay.He is a morn without a dawn, an evening without henna, anessence without attributes, a life without sorrow.How should the sun borrow light from the sky? How shouldthe rosebush borrow perfume from the jasmine? Be speechless as a fish and pure as the water of the sea thatyou may quickly become the trustee over the treasury of thepearl.  I will speak in your ear; do not tell anyone. Who is all that?Shams-i Din, the pride of Tabriz.I have heard that you are intending to journey; do not. Thatyou give your love to another friend and companion; do not.You are a stranger in the world; why do you estrange your-self? What heart-wounded victim are you aiming at? Do not.Do not steal yourself from us, do not go to strangers. Youare steathily glancing at the others; do not.Moon for whom the heavens are topsy-turvy, you waste usand turn us topsy-turvy; do not. What promise do you make and what oath do you swear?You make a shield of oaths and blandishments; do not.Where are the pledge and compact you made to your ser-vant? You depart from your pledge and word; do not.You whose court is higher than being and not being, you aretransgressing the bound of being; do not.You at whose command hell and heaven are slaves, you makeparadise like Gehenna to me; do not.In your sugarcane plot we are secure from poison; you arecommingling that poison with the sugar; do not. My soul is like a fiery furnace; is that not enough tor you?Through absence you are making my face pale as gold; do not.When you withdraw your lace, the moon is darkened withgrief; you are intending the eclipse of the moon’s orb; do not.Our lips become dry when you bring a draft: why are youwetting my eyes with tears? Do not.Since you cannot endure the shackling of lovers, why thendo you dazzle the eye of reason? Do not.You do not give sweetmeats to one sick of a fever; you hurtstill more him whose sickness you are; do not. My lawless eye is the thief of your beauty. Beloved, you re-quite the thievish eye; do not.  Withdraw, comrade, tor it is no time for speech. Why do youthrust yourself forward in the bewilderment of love? Do not.Give yourself a kiss, silvery- bodied idol; you who are inCathay, do not search for yourself in Khotan.If you would draw a silvery-bodied one into your bosom,where is the like of you? You must kiss the Beloved, then caressyour own mouth.For the sake of your beauty are the robes of the houris; thebeauty of every man or woman is the reflection of your lovelyface.The veil over your beauty is the tresses of your hair, else thelight of you would have shone out, O sweet of chin.The painter of the body came towards the idols of thethoughts; his hand and heart were broken, his mouth stoodopen.This painted cage is the veil of the bird of the heart; you havenot recognized the heart because of the heart-breaking cage.The heart flung off the veil from the clay of Adam, and all ofthe angels prostrated themselves.The intermediary would vanish if only for a moment love’sTurk sat down before his grace, saying, “O Chelebi, who areyou?”The eye would be endowed with sight of the unseen, if theglance of Shams-i Din, Pride of all of Tabriz, stole a wink at you.Whatever you do, know it is done by Me; whatever the bodydoes, the Soul has done it.You are my eyes, you are my ears; I have mentioned thesetwo, remember the rest.  If that treasure was not in the world, then to what end wouldit be a ruined house?Seek the treasure, my father; move your hand, move yourhand. His sweet scent has become our guide to rose and basil, torose and basil.Atom by atom all are purchasers; beware, do not sell yourpearl cheaply.The mouse will come out, the cat will come out, if you openthe mouth of the bag.When love is there, the soul suffers no diminution; may theshadow of the Beloved not be atariYou will recite the rest of this, moonfaced moon, shiningVenus!By your own life I implore, do not withdraw from this heart-less wretch; suffer me still, do not make for your house.Do not think of pretexts, leave excuses aside; treat me notaloofly, be not haughty.Wine is at hand, fortune our boon companion, and you thesaki; give the wine, play not saki’s frauds.Cast your glance at your companions who are drunk withyou, do not gaze at window and porch and threshold. Pass not your time save in the lovers’ circle, make not yournest save in the tavern quarter.See, the world is a snare and desire the bait; hasten not intoits snare, desire not the bait.When you have passed out of its snare, set your foot on thesky; let naught but the sphere of the threshold be under your feet.Heed not sunshine and moonshine; be alone, and seek onlythat Alone.Rest not without Him, like a bowl tossed on the water; donot take the bowl and set it running to every kitchen.  Time is bright and dark, warm and cold in turns; make notyour abode save at the fountainhead of time.Praise him not, neither cover him with reproaches; offer notpastries, and do not throw forward that garlic.But what is the use? For such are the ways of vain idols. Donot say to the brand of fire, “Do not make a flame.”Say to whatever your burn, “Burn,” save with separation;that is not allowable, do not perpetuate this one tyrannyeither.If my words were not worthy of your lips, then pick up aheavy stone and shatter my mouth.When a child speaks nonsense, does not the loving motherprick his lips to teach him manners?For the sake of the majesty of your lips, burn and tear andrend and dash to pieces two hundred mouths and worlds.When a thirsty man boldly runs to the seashore, does not thewave lift up its sword to his neck?I am the slave of the lily which, having seen your rose bowerand been put to shame by your narcissus, its ten tongues be-came dumb.But I am like a tambourine; when you strike your hand onme I cry out, “Beat my face like a mortar!”Lay me not aside until the concert grows hot; draw your skirtaside from the impure world.Yes, the eyes are intoxicated from the rose bower of mean-ing, yet the song of the bulbul is sweet in the rose bower.If Joseph’s beauty is fairer naked, yet the eyes are not openedsave by his shirt.Though the glitter of the sun of the soul is the origin, noman has reached that heaven without a body.Silence! for if the corpse-washer binds my mouth, you willhear this melody from the grave after I am dead.   iO seven seas, bestow pearls and transmute these things ofbrass; candle of drunkards and cypress of the garden, how longthese tricks? At last keep faith.Every granite rock wept for us, Beloved; cure this our pain.You angrily turned away your face; for a moment have donewith this behavior. You once showed much beneficence and humanity; redoublethat humanity.Fair of course, O moon and star, be generous in the darknessof night like the moon.Separate from us the ancient pain, the anguish of sickness,and the orphan’s dust.Though I be in paradise, in gold and silver, without you I aman orphan; cure me. have closed my lips and sat in sorrow; open my hand, maketor encounter.My darling came to me; through him my roof and doorsprang to life.I said, “Tonight you are my guest, O my provocation anddisturbance.”He said, “Let me go; there is important business tor me inthe city, soul and head of mine.”I said, “By God, if you depart, tonight this bodily form ofmine will not live.” “Why, will you not tor one night show compassion upon mygolden pale cheek?“Will not your happy eye show compassion upon this lamentand wet eye of mine?  “Let the rosebed of your cheek scatter roses over my tearssweet as Kauthar.”He said, “What can I do, seeing that Fate has poured theblood of all men into my cup?”I am of Mars, and only blood is in my ascendant, my star.io No incense is accepted by God until it enters my crucible.I said, “Since your aim is my life, only blood should be myfood and dessert.“You are cypress and rose, I am your shadow; I am slain byyou, you are my Haidar.”He said, “Only a rarity shall be my sacrificial offering, Oservant of mine.“Gurjis is arriving, tor every moment he is newly slain in my land. “Isaac the prophet should have been sacrificed to the dust ofmy door.“I am love, and if I shed your blood I will bring you to life inmy resurrection.“Beware, do not flutter in my clutch, do not shrink from mydagger;“Make not a wry face at death that my breast may givethanks to you.“Laugh like the rose when Death plucks you out and plungesyou in my sugar. “You are Isaac and I am your father; how should I shatteryou, my jewel?“Love is the father, the lover his flock; of him is born mypomp and pride.”So saying, he departed like the zephyr; the tears flowed frommy eyes.I said, “What would it be to you if you were to be kind anddepart slowly, my master?“Do not hasten: a little more slowly! Life and world andhundred -petaled rose of mine. “No one ever saw me hurry; this is my more lazy pace.“Yon sphere of heaven, if it tried its utmost, would neverreach to where I pass.”  He said, “Silence! for this gray horse of heaven goes lamelyin my presence .“Silence! for if you are not silent, this flame of mine will fallupon the thicket.“Do not say the rest of it till another day, that my heart maynot flee from my breast.”My saki rises without my speaking and brings that wine ofabundant price.There is no need for me to say, “Bring,” he hears the voiceof my heart without mouth.His intercessor is his own grace, his boundless generosity andgoodness.The moon rises, do not say to it, “Arise”; it casts light onyou, do not say, “Cast.”O you in time of festivity, the best joy and pleasure and intime of battle, the greatest breaker of ranks.Excellent guide for all who have lost the way, fine rope for allimprisoned in the well;The world is like night, and you the moon; you are like acandle, the souls a sconce.The soul is resdess like a mote; with you it becomes tranquil,O excellent tranquillity.You are my life, you are my life, my life; you are my own, youare my own, my own.You are my king, worthy of my passion; you are my candy,worthy of my teeth.You are my light; dwell within these eyes of mine, O my eyesand fountain of life!  When the rose beheld you, it said to the lily, “My cypresstree came to my rose garden.” Say, how are you in respect to two scattered things! yourhair, and my distracted state?The rope of your hair is my shackle, the well of your chin ismy prison.Where are you going, drunk, shaking your hands? Come tome, my laughing rose!A cry went up from my tavern, the heavens were split by mylitany:Finally victory has arrived, the Beloved has entered to tend me.Lord, lord, how He is acting, my unequaled Beloved, to rec-ompense me!That philosophers’ stone makes obedience and faith from myneglect and unbelief and sins. After my shortcomings He bestows a palace, after my slipsHe bestows victuals.He causes the heart of sea and mountain to surge from theheat of the day of my encounter.If the thoughts of man were not a veil, they would be burntto ashes by my thoughts.My drum and flag, my cry and shouting would strike agita-tion in the army of the spirit;The fire of my tryst at midnight would strike flames into thehorizon of the sky.Come nearer, my pretty idol, my sympathetic idol of like huewith me.See how my heart has become constricted with your coquet-tishness, till you say to me, “O my suffering one!”I battle with my heart as with an enemy till you say, “Bravo,my general!”How long will you ask, “Why is this face of yours pale?” It isthrough grieving tor you, my rose-hued idol. Last night all night to Venus reached the lamenting of thislyre -shaped body of mine.Purchase back my soul from my body, that my soul may es-cape my shame.Through the grace of your ruby lips my stonelike heart hasbecome a banker of gold.Accord peace to my soul and to me, for all my war is on youraccount.My foot becomes swifter going than the wind, if you say,“Come, my lame one!”io For this reason I am bound and suspended from you, thatmy rope of grapes through you may become like sugar.You are indifferent to me, and I am miserable; oh, what shallI become if you desire me?The Zangi of grief is at the door of happiness of Rum;ransom my Rum from my Zang.I fear not the untimeliness and the distance of the way;through you my parasang has become half a foot.My old age has become better than childhood, my wrinkledface has become fresh again. Be silent, be bewildered as silent ones, so that he may say toyou, “My silent and bewildered one!”Once more our crescent moon has reaped a harvest, andwe have paraded forth despite the foe.Once more the sun has entered Aries, made the world tolaugh like a rose garden.   The blossoms have mirthfully opened their lips, the lily hasslily become a tongue.What satins they have put on in the garden for that tailorwho has no scissors or needle! Every tree has set on its head a tray full of sweetmeats with-out syrup and oil.We have made our bellies a drum once more, since thedrummer of spring began drumming.The surface of the water, which in winter was as iron, hasbecome ruffled like chainmail by the wind;Perchance the early spring is the David of time, who hasfashioned a coat of armor out of that iron.God proclaimed in nonexistence, “Ho, herbs: Those coldones have left the dwelling.io “Turn your faces to the height of existence like the birds ofAbraham from their nest.”That gnostic crane has returned from exile, about him thestammering birds uttering praises.The routed ones who had become hidden have each puttheir head out of the window.The greenclads have put forth their heads, ear and neck fullof collars and jewels.It is concert, and thousands of houris in the garden arestamping their feet on the tomb of January. Ho, willow, awake and move your head and ears, if you havebright eyes like the narcissus.I say to speech, “Abandon me”; speech is contentious, it iscoming after me.I do not desire, because of his hard face, to declare the talk oflovers.The rose calls, “Ye Midianite, rejoice with us whoever wassorrowful.”The earth has become verdant with light, and God has saidto the naked, “Adorn yourself.” The fugitives have returned to life, the divcm of the resurrec-tion is now organized.   By God’s command they died, then they came to life. Hemade them decay for a while, then made them fair.God’s sun is rising with bounty, the proof of His handiworkis established.We have dyed the plants without a dye, we measure their sizewithout a mold.Paradise on paradise on paradise — dazzles one, take up yourhome therein.We have stirred up the souls to the heights; this one has at-tained union, that one played the Pharaoh.Ah, be silent and address them with silence, for silence ismore revealing of secrets.Lovers, lovers, whoever sees His lace, his reason becomesdistraught, his habit confounded.He becomes a seeker of the Beloved, his shop is ruined, heruns headlong like water in his river.He becomes in love like Majnun, head spinning like the sky;whoever is sick like this, his remedy is unobtainable.The angels prostrate before him who became God’s dust, theTurk of heaven becomes the servant of him who has becomeHis Hindu slave.His love places the aching heart on his hand and smells it;how did not that rejoice which has become His.Many a breast He has wounded, many a sleep He has barred;that magical glance of His has bound the hand of the magicians.Kings are all His beggars, beauties clippings of His beauty,lions drop their tail on the earth before His street-dogs.Glance once at heaven, at the fortress of the spiritual ones, somany lamps and torches on His towers and battlements.The keeper of His fortress is Universal Reason, that kingwithout drum and tabor; he alone climbs that fortress who nolonger possesses his own ownness.io Moon, have you seen His face and stolen beauty fromHim? Night, have you seen His hair? No, no, not one hair ofHim.This night wears black as a sign of mourning, like a black-robed widow whose husband has gone into the earth.Night makes a pretense and imposture; secretly it makesmerry, its eye closes no eye, its brow is set awry.Night, I do not believe this lamenting of yours; you are run-ning like a ball before the mallet of fate.He who is struck by His mallet carries the ball of happiness,he runs headlong like the heart about His street. Our cheeks are like saffron through love of His tulip bed, ourheart is sunk like a comb in His hair.Where is love’s back? Love is all face, back and face belong tothis side, His side is only face.He is free of form, His business is all form-fashioning.O heart, you will never transcend form because you are notsingle with Him.The heart of every pure man knows the voice of the heartfrom the voice of clay; this is the roaring of a lion in the form ofHis deer.What is woven by the hand of the One becomes revealed,becomes revealed from the workmanship of the weaver and hishand and shuttle . O souls His shuttle, O our qibla His street, heaven is thesweeper of this street, this earth its mistress.My heart is burning with envy for Him, my eyes have be-come His water bags: how should He be wet with tears, whilethe sea is up to His knees?This love has become my guest, struck a blow against mysoul; a hundred compassions and a hundred blessings to hishand and arm!I flung away hand and foot and had done with searching; mysearching is dead before His searching.Often I said, “O heart, be silent to this heart’s passion”; myha is useless when my heart hears His hit.  The glow of the light of daybreak is in your emerald vault,the goblet of the blood of twilight is your blood-measuringbowl.Mile on mile, torrent on torrent come dancing and glidingto the shore of your sea.With all the elevation and aspiration of the moon, the capfalls off the head of the moon when the moon raises its face togaze upon your height.Every morn the nightingales lament like the heart-forlornones to the melodies of those attaining your verdantmeadow.The spirits seek vision, the hearts all seek the Beloved; youin whose broad orchard four streams are let flow — one streampure water, another honey, the third fresh milk, the fourth yourruby wine .You never give me a chance, you are giving wine upon wine;where is the head, that I may describe the drinking-cup of yourwine?Yet who am I? Heaven itself in the round of this heavybumper finds not a moment’s peace from your love and thecraving for you.Moon of silver girdle, you have experience oflove; heaven,loverhood is apparent in your features.When love is yoked to the heart it wearies of the heart’schatter: heart, be silent! How long this striving and inquiringof yours?The heart said, “I am His reed pipe, I wail {by His breath.}”I said, “Be lamenting now, the slave of whose passion is thesoul.”We have opened your door; do not desert your companions;in thankfulness for an all-embracing love which has seized youfrom head to toe.  When laughter leaps forth from me, I keep laughter hiddenfrom him; I make a sour face at him; I shout and scream at him.If you joke and laugh at the sour ones, war arises; I have hid-den my laughter, I drop tears at him.A huge city is my body, grief on one side, I on the other; oneside I have water from him, on the other fire .With his sours I am sour, with his sugars I am sugar; he is myface, he is my back, through him I scratch the back of joy.A hundred the likes of me and you have become drunk in hismeadow, dancing, hand-clapping on the summit of every domethrough him.I am the parrot of candy and sugar, I eat only sugar; what-ever sour is in the world, I am far and indifferent to it.If he has given you sourness, to me he has given honey andsugar; he has made you jolting and lame, me smooth and evenof pace .Whoever travels not on this road, his path is all gully andsteep; I who am on this royal road am on a level path throughhim.My heart is the Masjid-i Aqsd , my heart is the Paradisehome; all my traces through him have become houris and light.To whomsoever God gives laughter, laughter leaps from hismouth; if you doubt Him, I am altogether in acknowledgementof Him.The rose’s portion is laughter, it has no weeping; what shallit do? Lilies and roses are blossoming in my conscious heartthrough Him.Patience was saying, “I bear good tidings of union fromHim; gratitude was saying, “I am the owner of stocks throughHim.”Reason was saying, “I am abstinent and sick through Him”;Love was saying “I am a magician and cutpurse through Him.”  Spirit was saying, “I am a pearl-possessing treasure throughHim”; Treasure was saying, “I am at the foundation of the wallthrough Him.”Ignorance was saying, “I am without knowledge and con-sciousness through Him”; Knowledge was saying, “I am thechief of the bazaar through Him.”Abstinence was saying, “I understand the secrets throughHim”; Poverty was saying, “I am without heart and turbanthrough Him.”If Shams-i Haqq returns to me from Tabriz, all my dis-courses will be expounded and revealed through Him.Whatever comes of the world’s affairs, how does that affectyour business? If the two worlds have become an idol-temple,where is that roguish idol of yours?Grant that the world is in famine, there is no bowl of wineand bread any more; O king of the manifest and hidden, whereare your measure and store?Grant that the world is all thorn, scorpion and snake;O joy and gladness of the soul, where are your rose bowerand rosebed?Grant that liberality itself is dead, that miserliness has slainall; O our heart and eye, where are your pension and robe ofhonor?Grant that both the sun and the moon have sunk into hell;O succor of hearing and sight, where are your torch and light?Grant that the jeweler is not after any customer, how shallyou not take the leadership? Where is your pearl-raining cloud?Grant there is no mouth, there is no speech of tongue to tellthe secrets; where is the surging of your heart?Come, leave all this, for we are drunk with union and en-counter; the hour is late — come quickly, where is this house ofyour vintner?  Drunken sharp-glancer of mine, my fellow in heart andhand, if you are not dissolute and in dotage, where are yourcloak and turban?A whore has carried off your cap, another your gown; yourface is pale with a moonlike beauty; where is your support andprotection?A stranger is waylaying the path to the drunkards of eter-nity: why do you not act the policeman? Where is your woundthrust? Where are your gallows?Silence, word-scatterer! Interpret not to ordinary peoplewhat is fit only for the ears of the silent ones; where is your ec-stasy and speech?Say, how shall a part of the world depart from the world?How shall moisture escape from water, one leap from two?No fire dies from another fire, my son; O my heart bleedingof love, wash not my blood in blood.However much I fled, my shadow did not leave me; shadowmust be in charge of me, even though I become as the thread ofa hair.Only the sun has the power to drive away shadows, the sunincreases and diminishes them; seek this from the sun.Though for two thousand years you are running in the backof the shadow, in the end you will see that you are behind andthe shadow before .Your sin has become your service, your pain your blessing,your candle your darkness, your bonds seeking and questing.I would explain this, only it would break the back of yourheart; when you break the glass of the heart, repairs are of noavail.You must have both shadow and light together; listen to me,lay your head down and prostrate yourself before the tree of thefear of God.  When from the tree of His grace wings and feathers sprout toryou, be silent as a dove, do not open your mouth for cooing.When a frog enters water, the snake cannot reach it; the frogcroaks and gives information so that the snake knows where he is.Even though the cunning frog should hiss like a snake, thefeeble frog-sound of his betrays the true voice.If the frog were silent, the snake would be his prey: whenit retires into its corner, the barleycorn and grain become atreasure.When the golden barleycorn has become a treasure, it doesnot diminish in the earth; the barleycorn of the soul becomes atreasure when it attains the treasure of Hu.Shall I finish these words, or shall I squeeze them again?Yours is the decree; what am I, O gracious king?The rock splits open in yearning to encounter you; the soulbeats wing and pinion in the joy of your air.Fire becomes water, reason is lain waste, my eye becomes thetoe of sleep on account of you.Rending the robe of patience, reason departs out of itself;your love like a dragon devours both men and stones.Do not bind the departer, do not turn laughter to weeping;be not cruel, tor your servant has none to take your place.When your water departs to the river, how shall my discourseflow well? Sometimes my breath ceases because you are so shy.What is the food of your love? This roasted liver of mine.What is my ruined heart? The workshop of your fidelity.The jar is fermenting; who will drink? The harp sings aloudin the description and praise of you.Love entered by my door and laid a hand on my head, sawthat I was without you, and said, “Alas for you!”I saw a difficult stage, involved and very complex; I went,and now remain a heart slain by your hand at your feet.Again I am raging. I am in such a state by your soul that ev-ery bond you bind, I break, by your soul.I am like heaven, like the moon, like a candle by your glow;I am all reason, all love, all soul, by your soul.My joy is of your doing, my hangover of your thorn; what-ever side you turn your face, I turn mine, by your soul.I spoke in error; it is not surprising to speak in error in thisstate, lor this moment I cannot tell cup from wine, by yoursoul.I am that madman in bonds who binds the divs; I, the mad-man, am a Solomon with the divs, by your soul.Whatever form other than love raises up its head from myheart, forthwith I drive it out of the court of my heart, by yoursoul.Come, you who have departed, for the thing that departscomes back; neither you are that, by my soul, nor I am that, byyour soul.Disbeliever, do not conceal disbelief in your soul, for I willrecite the secret of your destiny, by your soul.Out of love of Shams-i Tabriz!, through wakefulness ornight-rising, like a spinning mote I am distraught, by yoursoul.All my six directions, Beloved, are graven with your beauty,you shine in the mirror, since it has been polished by you.The mirror sees you according to the measure of its breadth;how shall the shapes of your perfection be contained in themirror?The sun asked your sun, “When shall I see you?” It replied,“I shall rise in the time of your setting.”  You cannot travel freely in this direction, for like a camelyour ropes, O reason, have bound your knees. How is it that reason, whose splendor is not contained in theseven heavens, entered your snare and bag, O love?This reason became one grain of the harvest of love, and allyour feathers and wings became trapped by that grain.You plunged once into the sea of the life of God, you saweternal spirit life, that spirit became your bane.Of what use is this reason’s kingship beside the sovereigntyof your love? Of what use his pomp beside your pomp andmajesty?See in the world’s ears now a hundred golden rings becauseof the grace of your answering, out of joy of your questioning,io Raw ones who never received refined gold from your handare happy with your stones and shards instead of gold.A hundred skies revolve around your earth, a hundred fullmoons prostrate before your crescent moon.With you our carnal soul’s dog plays foxy tricks, tor the lionprostrates before your jackal.Like day and night, footless we are journeying, O soul, sinceevery moment from heaven arrives your “Come up!”What shall be our darkness in the presence of your light?What our evil deeds with your beneficence? By day we revolve about your tree like a shadow, by night tilldawn we lament, secure from your wearying.Yearning tor your reproach, Adam came from the high seatof Paradise down to your vestibule.The heart’s sea thunders and boils with your praise, but Ihave closed my lips, yearning for your discourse.Both aware and untimely he came as my guest; my heart said,“Who has come?” My soul said, “The moonfaced moon.”He entered the house, we all like madmen searching for that  moon gone into the midst of the street.He was crying out from the house, “I am here”; we, heedlessof this cry, go crying everywhere.That drunken nightingale of ours is lamenting in our rosegarden, like ringdoves we are flying and shouting, “Where,where?” At midnight a crowd leaped out saying, “What? The thief hascome?” That thief also is saying, “The thief has come”; and heis the thief.His shout became so mingled with the shout of all othersthat not a bit of his shouting stands out in this uproar.And He is with yon means He is with you in this search; whenyou are seeking, seek Him too in the search.He is nearer to you than you; why go outside? Become likemelting snow, wash yourself of yourself.Through love a tongue grows in the soul like a lily; keepyour tongue silent, imitate the trait of the lily.From these depths depart towards heaven; may your soul behappy, journey joyfully.You have escaped from the city full of fear and trembling;happily become a resident of the Abode of Security.If the body’s image has gone, await the image-maker; if thebody is utterly ruined, become all soul.If your face has become saffron pale through death, becomea dweller among tulip beds and Judas trees. If the doors of repose have been barred to you, come, departby way of the roof and the ladder.If you are alone from friends and companions, by the help ofGod become a sdhib-qirdn lord of happy circumstance.If you have been secluded from water and bread, like breadbecome the food of the souls, and so become!  Sweetly parading you go — my soul of soul, go not withoutme; life of your friends, enter not the garden without me.Sky, revolve not without me; moon, shine not without me;earth travel not without me, and time, go not without me.With you this world is joyous, and with you that world isjoyous; in this world dwell not without me, and to that worlddepart not without me.Vision, know not without me, and tongue, recite not with-out me; glance behold not without me, and soul, go not with-out me . The night through the moon’s light sees its face white; I amnight, you are my moon, go not to heaven without me.The thorn is secure from the fire in the shelter of the rose’sgrace: you are the rose, I your thorn; go not into the rose gar-den without me .I run in the curve of your mallet when your eye is with me;even so gaze upon me, drive not without me, go not withoutme.When, joy, you are companion of the king, drink not with-out me; when, watchman, you go to the king’s roof, go notwithout me.Alas for him who goes on this road without your sign; sinceyou, O signless one, are my sign, go not without me. Alas for him who goes on this road without any knowledge;you are the knowledge of the road for me; O road-knower, gonot without me.Others call you love, I call you the king of love; O you whoare higher than the imagination of this and that, go not with-out me .  Last night in sleep I dreamed — yet what sleep is there forlovers? — that I was searching inside the Kaaba tor where aprayer-niche might be.The Kaaba of the spirits, not that Kaaba which, when youreach it on a dark night, you say, “Where is candle or moon-light?”Nay, rather its foundations are of the light of the wholeworld, from which the rays of your spirit take light. Only howcan the soul endure it?Its hospice is all light, its carpeting is knowledge and reason,its Sufis all bewildered, where is the clatter of the shoes?Fortunate one, the crown and throne you hold hidden inyou are beyond the imagination of Kai-Qubad and Sanjar andSuhrab.Bird of heart, fly amidst the garden of its beauty, for there isa secure abode; where is snare or beating-sticlc?There is a gift in the midst of your body’s loans; search in themiddle of the soul for the gift of Giver.In describing from afar the discourse of time became prolix;now that I have reached my tent-tope, where now is prolixity?Since you quitted the clay, you forthright entered the gardenof the heart; so from that side is there naught but concert andpure wine?Since you left the salt marsh of the body for the garden ofthe soul, is there naught but rose and basil, tulip and fountainsof water?Since you have seen thousands of beauties that were not ofbody, why do you say, “Where is the beauty of the Opener ofDoors?”Faqih, for God’s sake, learn the science oflove, for afterdeath, where are “lawful,” “unlawful” and “obligatory?”  When in time of pain and affliction you quickly find Hisdoor, you say once more, “Where is He? Where is the door ofHis palace?”Wait till the wave of union with Him snatches you away andyou become unseen, then you may say, “Where is the world ofcausation?”If the script of Ibn Bawwab has become your fancy in callig-raphy, read the letter of His love, and it will show you wherethe Doorkeeper is.Beware, say not of every man that he is God’s deputy; cometo the court of the qazi, then see where the deputies are.Until you box your ears, you will see only men’s affairs; whenyou rub your eyes, you will say, “Where is his light?”In the tavern of reality, before the dissolute drunkards, insuch a pure wine you will not see where lees and straw are andsecondary causes.In the mortal reckoning your life has been wasted withoutreckoning; behold the purity of the Beloved; where is the simili-tude of the reckoners?When the wine makes you brave and you plunge into thesea of the heart, you will strike up this melody: “Where is thebottom of this sea?”Happy the moment when we, you and I, sit in the palace,with two forms and two figures but with one soul, you and I.The beauty of the garden and the birdsong will confer uponus the water of life at that time when we enter the garden, youand I.The stars of heaven will come to gaze on us; we shall showthem the moon itself, you and I.You and I, unselfed, will be collected together in ecstasy,joyful, and indifferent to idle fable, you and I.  The parrots of heaven will all be sugar-cracking in the placewhere we laugh in suchwise, you and I.This is still more amazing, that you and I here in one cornerin this very moment are in Iraq and Khorasan, you and I.In one form upon this earth, and in another form in eternalparadise and the land of sugar, you and I.lYou who have made the lovers’ whole baggage a wager, donot shed the blood of these lovers, and do not depart.See the traces of blood at the top of the road, hear thebloody cry coming from all sides.I said to this heart, “See his mallet; if you are a ball, run intothis mallet.”The heart said, “In the curve of his mallet I have become oldand new a hundred thousand times.” How should the ball of the heart hide from the mallet? Forin this desert there is neither well nor ditch.The cat of the soul is the sneeze of the lion of eternity; thelion trembles when the cat mews.This is the gold of the mine of Shams-i Tabriz; search it grainby grain, it is all pure.Sit with your comrades, do not go to sleep; do not go to thebottom of the sea like a fish.Be surging all night like the sea; no, do not go scattered likea torrent.Is not the water of life in darkness? Seek in darkness, and donot hurry away.The nightfarers of heaven are full of light; you too, go not  away from the company of your companions. Is not the wakeful candle in a golden dish? Go not into earthlike quicksilver.The moon shows its face to the night-travelers; be watchful,on the night of moonshine do not go.I went to the master’s street and said, “Where is the master?”They said, “The master is a lover and is drunk and wanderingfrom street to street.”I said, “I have a duty, at least you give me a clue; after all, Iam the master’s friend, not an enemy.”They said, “The master has fallen in love with that gardener;seek him in the garden or beside the stream.”Drunkards and lovers go after their beloved; if a man hasfallen in love, go and wash your hands from him. The fish that has known water remains not on land; howshould a lover stay in the sphere of color and scent?The frozen snow that has seen the face of yon sun is de-voured by the sun, though it be heap on heap.Especially he who is in love with our king, a king peerless,faithful, sweet-tempered.Any copper which that infinite, immeasurable, incomparablealchemy touches becomes gold at the word Return.Sleep away from the world, and flee from the six directions;how long will you foolishly wander and roam hither andthither? Eventually in the end they will bring you of your own choice,go with glory and honor before the king.Elad there not been a meddler in the midst, Jesus would haverevealed the mystery line by line.I have closed the road of the mouth and opened the secretway; I have escaped by one cup of wine from the frenzy ofspeech.I am not satiated, not satiated with your laughing lips; athousand blessings on your lips and teeth!Has any man ever wearied, my son, of his soul? You are mysoul since my soul and yours are one and the same.I am thirsty and suffering from dropsy, my death and lifeare from water; pass around the cup, for I am the slave of yourturning around.You make dispensation, go offer me to yourself that my headmay raise itself up from your shirt.Though my two hands are wounded, my hand belongs toyou; of what use are my hands without your breath and incanta-tion?Your love said, “Sir, come into my private chamber, that nothief may make designs on your inner chamber.”I said, “Blessed one, I have become a ring on this door sothat no thought of me may trouble your doorkeeper.”He said, “You are both standing at the door and in my bo-som, exterior and interior — both homelands are yours.Silence, and recite no more; sufficient should be this hospi-tality and table. For all eternity Rum and Turk shall eat of yourtable.The light of my heart is your lovely face, my wings and pin-ions your gentleness;Festival and ‘arafa are your laughter, my musk and rose areyour sweet scent.My sign is the disc of your moon, my place of shade yourlovely hair.My prostration-place is the dust of your door, my leaping-place your delightful street.  My heart goes not to others, since it has gone in your sweetdirection.Even if my heart goes to others, your sweet “person” willdraw it back.My intoxication is of your being, my plunging-place yoursweet river.I have become like gold from your silvery bosom, I have be-come single through your sweet fold.I lay my head; and how should not your sweet ball lay downits head before your mallet?I will be silent, silent, since my clamoring is shattered byyour sweet cry.Come, beat the drum of fidelity, for your hour has come;give wine red as the Judas flowers, for your Judas tree has blos-somed.Let us press new wine from the sweet grapes of your garden,let us scatter fruits from your lusty young tree.Drive not soul and reason from the table of your bounty;what do two or three flies consume to diminish the plenty ofyour table?The desire of all the desirous is but one grain of your harvest;the two worlds are but two small townships in your world.If all day the sun strikes the sword of light, it becomes lessthan a mote before your terrible lance.Since the soul of heaven kisses the earth before you, on whatwing shall earth fly towards your heaven?It sits with broken wings, gazing towards you, for in thatsame moment there arrives to it the succor of your present.No night nor dawntide has passed in the world, inwhich my breath has not been set afire by the threat of yourwatchman.  Did you not make a promise to me? Did you not swearan oath, that at the time of my going up your ladder shouldarrive?When you gaze on your servant with that narcissus eye, hissoul flies from the place to your placelessness.You cherish him saying, “Sorrowful one, do not grievehenceforward, for heaven itself has thundered with your loudlamentation.“I am more compassionate in cherishing than mother andfather; it was to mature you that your trial occurred.“I will make a garden, a Paradise, a cure out of your pain;out of your smoke I will fashion a new heaven better than this.“I have spoken all, yet I have not spoken the root of the mat-ter, Beloved, for it is better that men should hear your secretfrom your own mouth.”Saki of the moonface, circulate the cup, deliver me out ofshame and name.Saki, I am a prisoner in your snare, for you have laid at everystep a snare .Have done with sloth, seize me! Be not slothful, for the tribehas departed.Is not sobriety the alighting-place of every care? Is not joybanned in anxiety?Fast, for fasting is great gain; the faster drinks the wine of thespirit.It is in tradition that whoever keeps the fast sees the moon ofGod in the evening time.It is not just that when I enter by the door, you should fleefrom me by the roof:You flee and I crying after you, “Be patient one moment, Ofleet of pace!”  Moslems, Moslems, what remedy is there? For I am con-sumed with fire, and yet this business is unsettled.There is no remedy but pure wine in cups which noble menhave circulated.The tale of lovers has no end, so we will be satisfied with this,and so farewell!The answer of Mutanabbl’s saying is this: “A heart whichwine cannot console.”There are a few dissolutes this side, hidden in the shade ofthe heart, and yonder sun shines from the roof of the heartupon their souls;Every star became a Venus, every mote a sun, sun and starsbefore them spinning like motes.Reason and heart, gone astray, have carried all the souls toheaven; every one of them has become a Kai-Khusrau and aking without parasol and standard.You have slain many a mount and gone around the world;journey into your soul, and behold a people become altogethersoul.With this divine benefaction, with this beauty and loveliness,see the command- worshippers absorbed in the command.Their hearts are as mirrors, those rancorless hearts of theirs;their hearts like the field of the skies, a king entering the field.Through their jubilees and ululations, their sugar-crackinglips, dessert and wine and that other thing have become cheapin our town.If I were unselfed as last night and thought not of the distur-bance, unselfed I would have spoken the rest of this;But lor now I close my mouth, because I am in pawn to my-self, till the time when my heart has become drunk with him.King of the kings of the soul, Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz —through him every soul has become a sea, every body a coral.   Lovers, lovers, I am mad; where is the chain? Chain-rattler ofthe soul, your clamor fills the world.You have forged another chain and flung it upon my neclc;you have galloped from heaven to waylay the caravan.Rise, soul, from the world, fly from earth and earth’s plot; forour sake this torch is revolving in heaven.He who is pained at heart, how shall his way be barred byrain and mud? That man is quit of love for whom mountain hasnot become a mustard grain.One day a hermaphrodite cried, saying, “Wicked shep-herd, why, that goat is biting me, he looked at me from theflock.”The shepherd said, “He bites the hermaphrodite and perhapsslays him underfoot, but should that trouble a real man?” “Youhave spoken well,” said the other.Where is your reason, if you speak? Where your toot to gorunning, to go from dry land to sea and become secure fromthe earthquake?Then you will become king of kings, enter the ternal king-dom, rise higher than the heaven, depart from this dunghill;Active like the Universal Reason, surging like a sea of honey,like the sun in Aries, like the moon in Virgo.A hundred crows and owls and doves are making melodyin your ears; if only this clamor were less, you would hear thesounds of the heart.If you are a man of heart, become without heart; if you havereason, become mad, tor this partial reason is becoming a styein the eye of your love,So that the unseen form may arrive and draw you out ofform — for this problem has become difficult through its tan-gled locks.But on this road you must trail the skirt of joy because thestage is drenched with lovers’ blood.   Go, go, heart, with the caravan; go not alone on the stagebecause this pregnant age is giving birth to troubles;There you will be freed from pains, and go in the protectionof God; go in the sea like a skiff. Heart, you have gone; go with-out complaining.When you have removed heart from soul, you have escapedfrom war and peace; you have become free and unconcernedwith both shop and grain.Your soul has escaped from anxiety, the road to dangersis barred; he who is attached to you, is always in forty dayseclusion.Since by day you have become secure from this uproariousthe master, by night too do not worry about this jangling Zangi.Be silent, sweet of presence; saki, bind up your waterskin,because the waves are not contained in pitcher and flagon.Happy-cheeked saki of mine, give the cup like pomegranateblossom; if for my sake you will not give for the sake of theheart of the Beloved.Saki, you are the darling, you are the sick man’s cure; quick,give the draft of gladness and healing to the sick.Pour wine out in this bowl, smite the neck of anxiety; now,do not break my heart, my heart and sweetheart, and give.Open that tavern, abandon this rowdiness; give to the thirst-stricken lover from the vintner’s vat.You are the soul of spring and garden, the glory of cypressand jasmine; now make no excuses, roguish idol, but give!When you set foot on trickery and start away from thedrunkards’ hands our enemy will rejoice; despite strangers,give!Give not grief and sighing, open the way only to joy; a sighproceeds from the wayless; open the way; give audience.  We are all intoxicated of the encounter, athirst for thebumper of immortality; as pawns, give robe and turban beforethe saki.I am athirst of old, hot of heart and breast; break the beakerand cup, give much, without measure.You are both moon and moonshine, I am the fish of thiswater; the moon cannot reach the fish, so give generously of themoonshine.I am seeing a moon outside the eye in the eye, which neithereye has seen nor ear heard of.I do not see tongue and soul and heart save without myself,from that moment that I stole a glance at that cheek.Had Plato seen the loveliness and beauty of that moon, hewould have become even madder and more distressed than I.Eternity is the mirror of the temporal, the temporal the mir-ror of pre -eternity — in this mirror those two are twisted to-gether like his tresses.A cloud beyond the senses whose rain is all spirit; sprinklingon the dust of the body — what rains he has rained!The moonfaced ones of heaven, seeing the picture of hisface, have become ashamed before that beauty and scratchedthe back of their necks.Posteternity took the hand of pre-eternity and took it to-wards the palace of that moon: having seen both, it laughed injealous pride at the two.About and around his palace what lions there are, roaringjealously, aiming at the blood of the self-sacrificing, adventur-ous men.Suddenly the word jumped from my mouth, “Who is thatking? Shams al-DTn king of Tabriz”; and at those words myblood surged.  Undaunted you are coming from my breast into my sight,chanting a potent spell and confused stories.With one breath you bring into whirling the heavens and firma-ment; what would one rotting perception be before your spell?You wash away the sins of both worlds at a single penitence;why have you tightened my slip around your finger?You have a Job in every corner, a Jacob on every side; lovehas broken their door and stolen their cloths from the house.Parade forth to the cemetery and in that garden proclaim,“Rise, ancient dead, dance, crumbled body!”At once the whole cemetery becomes populated like a city,all dancing, all happy, fate turning back from all.I do not boast of this at random, I am not weaving a fantasy;I have seen this a hundred ways, I am not speaking of what Ihave not seen.If anyone says, “I have fled from the people, I have gone,”say, “He speaks the truth if his shirt is torn from behind.”Be silent; listen, speaker, to the sorrow of the beloved withthe lover; the {object} of the quest is obstinate, so long as thequestor is a seeker.Suddenly, having eaten nothing and taken away nothing, Ifell from the garden palace and pavilion into the depths of sucha well.The world was no festival for me; I beheld its ugliness, thatyellow wanton puts rouge on her face.How does rouge beautify that thorn of evil root? That thornwhich has sunk into every liver and kidney?She came, that blind crone, with a crown of roses, her blackribbon let loose, having blackened her eyebrows with indigo.  Look not at her anklets, regard her black legs; puppetry isvery pretty — when behind a screen!Go, wash your hands of her, Sufi of well-washed face; shaveyour heart of her, man of the shaven head!Unlucky and heavy of soul is he who seeks fortune from her;he is gone in bondage to greatness, and burns like a chip.Come to our aid, Beloved, amongst the heavy-hearted, youwho brought us into this wheel out of nonexistence.Silence! Speak only of that infinite one of sweet breath; howlong will you make discourse of these numbered breaths?O you whose soul had informed my soul of itself, yourthought every moment has made an impression on your slave.Whatever you think whatever enters your mind, that sameinstant that thing passes into your servant’s mind.My soul has become occupied with your graceful airs; yourguile in secret has wrought another thing.Every morn the reed laments, remembering your lip; yourlove fills the mouth of the reed with candy and sugar. Because of your moonlike face and your stature and waist,this soul of mine has made itself like the new moon.When I make myself like a belt, perhaps you will come to mywaist, O you whose eye you have fixed on me in wrath.In wrath you gazed and turned my heart upside down, sothat this wandering heart journeyed out of itself.That stranger-beloved of mine has returned to the house;today gaze about and behold strange forms!See the faithful friends, see the brethren of purity, dancingbecause that treasure has returned to the ruin.   eye, behold the garden; ear, gather the words, open yoursweet lips, beloved of fair legend.Saki today unsparingly pour the immortal wine; what doesthe sea diminish through those two or three measures?Measure and measure in wine is not duality, if you want it tobecome one, break the two measures. am a falcon of the hunt, beloved, do not keep me in bonds;I will be no more like an owl in a ruin.I am not content with you, patience has strayed from myheart; go, speak to another, I will not listen to your fable.I am a grain of the skies, tor a while I am in this earth; whenthe justice of spring comes the grain becomes green.You are the bane of birds; of that grain which you know, youscatter a handful from a garner full of grain.You who have given me lustre a hundredfold like the bluesky, beloved, answer frankly, is this so or not?Beloved, once more shake the chain and from afar gaze uponthe madmen.This is the very rose bower of fortune, Lord, what a tree isthis! A hundred drunken nightingales every moment make theirnest here.The soul comes, being dragged by the ear; the heart comesto the lovely ones, because spring has come and that strangerDecember has gone.Every day is festival and Friday for the poor; has not yester-day’s Friday become an ancient festival?O soul, robed in festive garb like the festival moon, made ofthe light of the beauty of yourself, not of woolen frock;Like reason and faith sweet outside and inside, not garlicstuffed in the heart of a walnut-sweet.Put on such a frock and go about in this ring, like the heartclear and bright in the vestibule of the heart.  On a running river, O soul, how shall a straw stand still?How can rancor make its dwelling in the soul and spirit?In the eye of sanctity these words are a branch new and fresh;in the eye of sensual perception, they are like an ancient legend.O formless Beloved of the pure torm-fashioner, O you whohave given the cup full of tumult to the lovers,You have closed your mouth against uttering secrets, andopened in the heart the door which I do not mention.Since your beauty secretly cast off the veil, heart has goneafter saki and head after wine.In the morning when your image drove forth riding, holyspirits, as numerous as the sands, followed on foot; And those who are famous in heaven for their adorationbroke their rosaries and pawned their prayer rugs.The soul cannot endure to gaze on your face unveiled; yourbeauty exceeds all that I say.My soul runs after you like a raging camel; my body is a col-lar bound upon the neck of that camel.Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz, my heart is pregnant by you; whenshall I see a child born under your auspices?The dissolutes are all assembled in the Magian monastery;give one bumper to that unique elder.The blood-shedding master, love, has seized door and roof,and reason is fugitive from house to house.That most mighty beauty flung aside one veil, and all thepeople of the time departed out of the veil.The same is with the lovers who fell into this sea; what placeis there for safety and security?  How shall love grow cold from the voice of reproach? A lionnever runs from a woman’s scream.Fill the bumper with the divine wine, leave not the “gods” ofnature standing in the midst.First give that bumper to the talkative soul, so that its speak-ing faculty may not utter any more legends.Once speech is blocked, a torrent will come so that you willsee not one sign left of beings and places.What a fire Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz has kindled! Brave, fire,congratulations, O flames!This midnight who has come like moonshine? It is the mes-senger oflove, coming from the prayer-niche.Bringing a torch, he has set fire to sleep; he has come fromthe presence of the unsleepy king.Who is this who has started all this tumult in the city, whocame upon the harvest of the darvish like a flood?Who is this? Say, for in all the world there is none but he, aking came to the door of the house of a doorkeeper. Who is this who has spread such a table of bounty, who hascome laughing, to lead the companions to the table?A cup is in his hand which makes an end of the dervish; fromthat grape’s juice the color stains his lips.Hearts are trembling, all souls impatient — one fraction ofthat trembling has fallen upon quicksilver.That gentleness and grace with which he treats his servant isthe same gentleness and grace which make the ermine.Of that lament and those tears which are the dry and wet oflove, one gentle melody has reached the waterwheel. A bunch of keys is under love’s armpit, come to open all thegates.Bird of the heart, if the hunter has broken your wings, yet thebird escapes from the snare when it is beaten and broken dead.  Silence! Embodied similitudes are not mannerly, or mannershave never entered your ear.As it is late and raining, to home, to home! Welcome, allfriends, to home, to home!How long like owls banished about the ruins? To home, tohome!Bright-hearted companions, haste, despite all the blind ones,to home, to home!You reasonable, sober, full of sorrow, do not disturb ourhearts! To home, to home!How long this loveplay with devil’s forms, calling themhouris? To home, to home!You have seen the grain and not seen the harvest; even so areants, to home, to home!Make not how and why; friend, leave grazing to cattle, tohome, to home!In that house is the concert of the circumcision feast, withthe ritually pure, to home, to home!Shams al-Din-i Tabriz has built a home for the naked; tohome, to home.Your heart has become like granite rock, and what can bedone with granite rock?What can glass do with granite rock, except become shat-tered to pieces.You laugh like the true dawn that the star may yield its lifebefore you.Since love opened its bosom, thought has fled intoboundary;  When patience perceived that flight, it too escaped onhorse.Patience and reason are gone; passion remained, weepingand in a fever.Some men, being separated from your wine, are fallen on theroad like dregs;Though their livers have turned to blood, yet they are nim-ble and reckless on this path.Because of this business we have become strangers to reasonand to the busybody heart.Love is the reality of command; poetry is the drum ofindication.Beware, for our prince is galloping, every morning he is on araid.Leave this theme of loneliness and separation, out of terrorof which descriptive language breaks.The imam has fled; muezzin, be silent, descend from theminaret.What is this hurricane blowing along from heaven? Hun-dreds of thousands of ships staggering and reeling before it.The ship escapes through the wind and is sunk by the wind;by the wind it is given life and is done to death.The wind in God’s command is like the breath in yours — byyour command brought to cursing or reciting praises.Know that the winds are various as fanned by the fan of pre-destination; by the zephyr the world is prosperous, by the pesti-lence it is reduced to a waste.Lord, you have shown the wind, do not hide the fan; to seethe fan is the lamp of the breast of the pure ones.Whoever sees it as a secondary cause is surely a form-worshiper; whoever sees it as cause has become the reality-knowing light.  The people of form give their lives for the desire of a bead;to the eyes of people of the sea of reality, pearls have becomecheap.The imitator, becoming the dust of true men, transmits re-ports from them; the others keep silence, concealed behindthem.The seeker kept his eye to the path and picked up chip-pings; see that chipping-piclcer of the road has now entered themine.We tremble over our faith as a mother over her child; ofwhat should that clever one tremble who has become entirelyfaith?Like a moon you are waning in the desire for leadership; letme see you like a sun, become a king without retinue.How long will you say that smoke is a proof of fire? Silence!Let me see you become without smoke both fire and proof.Say how long heaven has turned and goes on turning overyour head; let me see you like Messiah gone above heaven!You who seek a portion from me — “Bring this and that!” —let me see you escape from this and that, and become that andthat.Enough brawling drunkard, chattering talker, let me see youbecome silent-speaking like the pan of the balance.Ha, to and enter the sea; do not look on from afar, tor thepearl is in the depths of the sea, the foam on the shore .When you have seen the face of the king, go forth from thehouse like a pawn; when you have seen the face of the sun, be-come lost like a star.When by that slave-cherishing you have become pure and aman of prayer, invite all like the muezzin from the minaret.Gaze on this moon through which your heart has becomebright, look upon this king who has arrived on horseback.  I will not fear and tremble when he draws the dagger of om-nipotence; by God I will give his dagger a bribe and a portion.What water is there that matches his grace? For he pro-duces two hundred fountains from the breast of marble androck.All day you dance for vermicelli and porridge; what do youknow of the desire of the heart tor this verse and song?Since I saw his silvery breast I flee from silver and gold, forhis breeze flees away from the hand that counts silver.You have no fruit because you are light-laden like the willow;you have nothing of that business because you have become ajack-of- all-trades.All the pilgrims have gone to the sanctuary and seen theKaaba; you have not even bought a camel with a broken bridle.Look at your companions, all drunk and dissolute; be silent,and become likewise, you brawler.Give that spirited wine, for we are all in such a state that wecannot tell wine from cup, head from foot.We are all fresher than the lily and the rose branch, becomeentirely spirit and spiritual glow.All men are in the bond of passion, and passion is our slave,for we have all escaped from this cycle of time.Like the reed pipe we make voice at the sugar lip of theBeloved; we sell the shop for we are all mine.The light of the sun devours our bodies like a shadow, for inform we are like being and space.Our faces are saffron -pale out of fear for the evil eye; we arecompanions of the garden and tulipbed.We bring the Koran and swear an oath to the saki: “But fromyour hand and palm we will not take wine.”Whoever has a soul catches the scent of the rose garden ofthe soul; whoever has that realizes we are all that.Our hearts are free of care like the heart of a bird, for we areall lighthearted for that heavy cup.Kings yield up their crowns of gold in love for our path, forwe are more belt-bestowing than youthful fortune.Seek our souls in the front line of battle, for we go forwardlike arrow and lance.We do not sit behind the veil of the shadows of mankind, forlike the light of dawn we all tear veils apart.We were evening, through the sun of the world we havebecome morning; we were wolves, now we are famous shep-herds.Since Shams-i Tabriz displayed his soul-adorning cheek, weare running like the spirit towards him with heart and soul.O soul, who is that standing in the house of the heart? Whomay be on the royal throne but the king and the prince?He signaled with his hand, “Tell me, what do you want ofme?” What does a drunken man desire but sweetmeats and acup of wine?Sweetmeats hanging from the heart, a cup of pure light, aneternal banquet laid in the privacy of “He is the Truth.”How many deceivers there are at the wine-drinkers’ feast!Beware, lest you fall, soft and simple man!In the circle of reprobates beware lest you be eye-shut likethe bud, mouth-open like the rose.The world is like a mirror, the image of the perfection ofLove; men, who has ever seen a part greater than the whole?Go on foot like the grass, for in this rose garden the Belovedlike a rose is riding; all the rest are on foot.He is both sword and swordsman, both slain and slayer, allReason, and giving reason to the mind.That king is Salah al-DIn — may he endure forever, may hisbountiful hand be perpetually a necklace on my neck!  I saw my sweetheart wandering about the house; he hadtaken a rebec and was playing a melody.With a plectrum like fire he was playing a sweet melody,drunken and dissolute and charming from the Magianwine.He was invoking the saki in the air of Iraq; the wine was hisobject, the saki was his excuse.The moonfaced saki, pitcher in his hand, entered from a cor-ner and set it in the middle. He filled the first cup with that flaming wine; did you eversee water sending out flames?He set it on his hand for the sake of the lovers, then pros-trated and kissed the threshold.My sweetheart seized it from him and quaffed the wine;flames from that wine went running over his face.He was beholding his own beauty, and saying to the evil eye,“Never has there been, nor shall there come in this age, anotherlike me.”I am sprung from you and likewise you have devoured me, Imelt in you since through you I froze.Now you press me in your hand, now under your footwith grief; for the grape does not become wine until it ispressed.Like the light of the sun, you have cast us on the earth, thenlittle by little carried us back in that direction.We return from the body’s window like light into the orb ofa sun, pure of sin and blemish. Whoever sees that orb says, “He has become alive,” andwhoever comes to the window says, “So-and-so is dead.”  He has veiled our origin in that cup of pain and joy; in thecore of origin we are pure, all the rest left behind like dregs.Source of the source of souls, Shams-i Haqq-i Tabriz, ahundred livers are on fire for you — so how many kidneys?The sun has risen from the depths of the water, hear La ilahailia ’ llah from every mote.Why speak of motes? When the sun of the soul arrived, theyrobbed from the sun its very cloak and cap.The moon of the heart like Adam has emerged from waterand clay, and a hundred suns like Joseph are going down intothe well.Lift a head from the earth, for you are not less than an ant;carry to the ants the tidings of the plain and threshing floor.The ant was satisfied with that rotted grain because it wasnot aware of our verdant ear of corn.Say to the ant, “It is springtime, and you have hands and feet;why do you not make your way from the tomb to the open land?”Why speak of ants? Solomon has rent the robe of yearning;punish me not, O God, for this useless image.But they cut a gown to fit the purchaser’s figure; though thegarment is long, the stature is short.Bring a long stature, that we may cut a gown before whoselength the moon’s bowstring is broken.I keep silence hereafter, that through my silence truth andfalsehood may be separated as grain from chaff.Since I am intoxicated with your face, learned sage, gaze onme with those intoxicated eyes.Through your intoxicated eyes my heart writhes (for it is  mad); drunkard and madman have a liking for each other’sways.See my wasted heart and look fondly on me, for the sungazes fondly upon ruins.Go gaze, so that, by that one gaze which you gaze, mar-velous trees will emerge from a single seed. Your two eyes are Persian-Turlc and drunk and blood-spilling; the Persian shoots Turkish arrows.They have so plundered me and the house of the heart, thatHasanak is running with naked feet in the house.We will come into the garden of your face and break upthe house; we will manfully turn a thousand houses into adesert.Salah al-Din, you are as the moon and have no need ofthis description, even as the tress-tip of houris needs no comb.For a moment lay your cheek on the cheek of this drunkard,for a moment put behind your war and cruelty.If it be hard, I bring out silver in my hand; put in this handwine like gold.You who have opened the doors of the seven heavens, lay thehand of generosity on my fettered heart.All I have to offer is not-being; give the nickname of being tomy not-being. You are both breaker and binder of the broken; lay the balmof the soul on my broken head.Do not put a seal on that sugar and pistachio nut; lay ever-lasting love upon this servant.I have told you fifty times, O heart: do not hunt, put yourfoot in this net.  Circumambulating about your moon, the moon and skyand Jupiter, the sun and hooplike sphere come into yoursphere —O lord, am I seeking you or are you seeking me? O myshame! So long as I am, I am one and you are another;Suspending us and me, shedding the blood of both, raisingup something else, neither of man nor peri.Let toot not remain, for foot carries us to the thorn bush;let head not remain, for the head becomes infidel through two-headedness.One water flowing amidst the stream, one water frozen onthe bank of the stream; the former swift, the latter sluggish;beware, swift one, lest you congeal.The sun says to the stone, “For this reason I shone on yourstone, that you might escape from stoniness and set loot ongemhood.”The sun of eternal love has shone in your heart; first, thatyour servanthood might increase, and lastly, that you mightshow mastery.The sun says to the unripe grape, “I have come to yourkitchen so that you may not sell vinegar anymore but make atrade of sweetmaking.”The king says to the falcon, “I bound up your eyes so thatyou may break with your own kind and only regard my face.”The falcon says, “Yes, I am obedient; only on your beautyI gaze, only by your image I pass, and serve you with mysoul.”The rose says to the garden, “I displayed my robes so thatyou might sell all your wares and make do with me.”He who takes gold from here and makes do with anotherbeloved — sit awry and say truly, what is that from? Fromassishness?That is a man who gives up the ass to buy Jesus; it is of  assishness that you give up Jesus to buy the ass.Jesus turns the drunkard into gold, and if he be gold, makeshim into a jewel; if a jewel, he makes him better still, better thanthe moon and Jupiter.You are not a Jupiter without worth, but the light of God haspurchased: if you have anything of Joseph, you take the scent ofthis shirt.To me, as to Mary, dates come forth from a withered branchwithout cause; to me, like Jesus, mastership comes unasked inthe cradle.See the grapes without garden and vine, the light withoutday and night; this glorious fortune, given by God without theprocess of judgment.Through my firelike face the world’s bath became hot; likechildren weep less for a picture painted on the bathhouse wall.Tomorrow you will see its face become food for snake andmouse, those narcissus eyes a gateway of ants.You are the moonshine driven to the moon, the wall leftdark; to Him we return has come true — Look yonder, if youcan see.Or go to Tabriz, enjoy Shams al-Din, or believe the words ofthe truthful describers.Beware, Joseph of the fair name, come not on the road with-out a fellow traveler; break not away from the Jacob of wisdomlest you fall into a well.He is a dog who sleeps idly before every door; and he is anass who comes helplessly to every tent.See from what side this love and envy enter the breast; doyou know who informs the heart but a heart-cherisher?Wait like a bird guardian over the egg, for from the breast’segg will be born drunkenness and union and laughter.  Only he has a skirt; all are beggars, uncle — clutch with bothyour hands his royal skirt.Like the sun go in grief tor him into the fire till night; whenit is night, gently turn about his roof like the moon.On his roof these stars are keeping watch till dawn; by Allah,what a blessed presence, what an imperial court!Those prophets who even in the earth turned their faces toheaven escaped from the snare of earth and the company ofevery fool;They were snatched by that side like iron by a magnet, like astraw which flies without wings to amber.Know that without His sending down no provision grows inthe earth, without the society of His guiding form no substancecan come into being.The spirits are excited like camels by the cry, “Travel !” — likea Bedouin He cries, “Forward!” to those camels.On the table of the heart the soothsayer casts the sand div-ination realities, so that through His figures the sand has be-come fine gold and pure.Go more gaily, fellow travelers, for a physician has come intothe world who brings to life every dead one, gives sight to allwho are blind.All these things come to pass; but when his face lifts the veil,no Venus or melody remains, no “woe, woe” to the mourner.Be silent, if you are a nightingale, go, fly back to the rose-bush; the bolbol goes to the thornbed, but only rarely, fromtime to time.Before this I sought a purchaser for my discourse, and now Iwish of you to buy me from my words.I have carved idols enough to beguile every person; now Iam drunk with Abraham, I am sated with Azar.  An idol without color and scent arrived; my hand was putout of action by him. Seek another master tor the shop of idol-making.I have cleared the shop of myself, I have thrown away thetools; having realized the worth of madness, I have become freeof thoughts. If an image enters my heart I say, “Depart, you who leadastray!” If it displays grossness, I destroy its composition.Who is suitable for Laili? He who becomes Majnun for her.That man is at the foot of the flag whose soul is on the otherside.Do not fling stones at the factory of glassmaking, do notstrike anew the wounded heart of the broken-hearted.Strike all at my heart, for it is a pity and stupidity for yourblows and stones to strike another’s breast and soul.Free all the captives of cruelty save me, that on your servantyou may look with cruelty.I am happy whether you are faithful or cruel; may I neverjourney without you, either in fidelity or cruelty. If your image has not entered the eye of a particular man, theeye of a slain ibex is dark and gazes wildly.Before the world’s prison I was with you wholly; would thatI had never passed by this place of snares.How often I have said, “I am happy. I will not go on a jour-ney”; see this hard journey, the road from the heights to theearth.Your grace deluded me, saying “Go, do not be afraid: mygenerosity shall be your escort, there shall be no danger toyou.“When you go into strange lands, you will have time tobecome mature; then you will return to your homeland withlearning and accomplishment.”  I said, “O soul of mine, what information shall I gain with-out you? Who goes from you for the sake of information? Onlythe uninformed.“When I quaff wine from your hand, I am unaware anddrunk and happy, without danger and fear of anyone, untrou-bled by any man.”He spoke words in my ear like the words of highwaymen; theking rolled me off my head, he bewitched me.The story is long indeed — alas for the cunning and deceit, ifthis night his generosity does not show us any dawn.You have come in order to expound my secret to all, to re-veal and indicate that signless king.Last night your drunken fantasy came cup in hand. I said, “Iwill not drink wine”; it said, “Do not, the more loss to you.”I said, “I fear if I drink, shame will fly from my head; I willreach out to your curls, and you will withdraw from me.”It saw that I was making airs and said, “Come, it is astonish-ing that when someone offers you his soul, you should frownon him.“With all you are deceit and cheating; with the like of mewould you be the cheat too? I am the provost of secrets; do youhide a secret from me?“I am the treasure of the heart of earth; why do you lay yourhead on the earth? I am the qibla of heaven; why do you turnyour face to heaven?“Look at the king who gives you the {light} of vision; if youangrily turn your head away, you will do the same on the day ofdeath.“Be pale of cheek for him who gave you the color of yourcheeks; why do you saffron your face for the sake of a shadow?“Be like a cock, time-aware and leader; it would be a pity tomake your cock into a hen.  io “Sit crookedly but tell the truth; truth has its reward. I amyour soul and spirit — do you depart to another?“If like Lend, you lend God a clipping, you will turn half aclipping of counterfeit into a treasure and mine;“And if tor two or three days you bandage your eyes withLear God, you will make the fountain of your sensible eye into asea of the pearl of vision.“If for a moment you go straight as an arrow at my target,you will make the shaft of the arrow of heaven a bow for yourstring.“Is there any generosity better than this, that with your sinsand guilt I should expound how you should lament beforeme? “Enough for those words which will be written are not con-tained in the mouth; if you were to open every atom, you couldmake a mouth.”The sand has become satiated with the water; I have notbecome, bravo! No string in this world is there to fit my longbow.The sea is my least draft, the mountain my least morsel; whata leviathan I am. O God! Open for me a way.I am more thirsty than death, I writhe like hell; is not anygood fat morsel coming to me, I wonder?The lean one oflove has no remedy but union; none is therebut your hand to feed grass to the mouth oflove. Reason enters your trap and loses both head and beard,though it be heavy-headed or swift to leap.You are the implanter of sincerity in the heart of every Uni-tarian; you likewise print images in the heart of every anthro-pomorphist.Noah from the zenith of your wave becomes mate of a raft;  spirit from the scent of your street is drunk and dissolute anddistraught.Be silent, and return to the palace of the silent ones; you, castin a village, return to the city of love.Restless heart of mine, say, of what substance are you? Offire? Of water? Of man? Of peri?From what direction have you come? On what food pas-tured? What have you seen in nonexistence? Why are you flyingthither?Why do you uproot me? Why aim at my destruction? Whycut the road of wisdom? Why tear your own veil?All animals and living beings are wary of nothingness exceptyou, who are carrying your baggage into nonentity.You are going hot and hurrying, drunk, dissolute, to whosecounsel would you hearken? How long will you fall for the co-quetry of men?You are a torrent flowing, flowing from the mountaintop ofthis world towards the sea of no-place, faster than my breath.Garden and spring are bewildered to know by what breezeyou blow; lily and cypress are intoxicated with you: what a rose,what a narcissus you are!The music of the tambourine whose hoop is not accompa-nied by tinkling cymbals, like the ravings of an unbeliever, en-ters not our ears.The Moses of your love said to me “Become untouchable”;how do I not flee from all? How not run away from the Samari-tan?I have fled from all, though I am in the midst of men, as theJa‘fari gold coin is in the midst of the earth of the mine.Though the gold cries out two thousand times, “I am gold,”till it leaves the mine, no one will purchase it.  Do not heap snow on yourself, lest you congeal; your snowwill make you congeal even though you be the furnace of fire.He who does not ferment of himself destroys your ferment;and he who kindles no fire, brotherhood does not come fromhim.Look for his fatness with your hand, be not deceived by hiswool; don’t look at his head and moustaches, his soul is lean.If this melody is joyful, leap up and advance ardently; donot make your head so-and-so, do not listen slackly and super-ficially.I would have shown my face to you if I were not whollysoul; the sign of me would have been seen were I not withoutsign.Silver of bosom, am I not gold? Ruby of lips, am I not jewel?I would have shown my gold-essence were I not in the mine.Your grace does not let me, else I would drive away all thepeople of the world in desire of you, O sugar, like a fly.The rosebush of the soul said to your love, “Did I not fear, Iwould be all tongue like the lily.” Men say, “You are a reasonable man, for a moment come toyourself.” I reply, “If I were like this, for a moment I would belike that.”If the silver-robed moon were worthy of your street, I wouldtake him by the waist and draw him along to you.If the wave of passion for your love let me be for a moment, Iwould extinguish all fires and be the salvation oflovers.If he had not sewed up my eye of time with the arrow of jeal-ousy, I would be openly and visibly like a bow in his hand.  This is a symbol and metonymy for Tabriz and Shams-i Din;ah, how would it be if I had been an interpreter before him.Passion for that Beloved brought me out of learning andreciting so that I became mad and distracted.Once I took my way earnestly to prayer rug and mosque; Iput on the shirt of abstinence to increase good works.Love entered the mosque and said, “Right- guided master,rend the bond of being; why are you in bondage to prayer?“Let not your heart tremble before the blow of my sword;lay down your neck, if you wish to journey from knowledge tovision.“Do full justice to ruffianism, if you are a dissolute anddrunkard; if you are lovely and beautiful, why do you remainbehind the veil?“Lovely ones may not flee from exhibiting their features;how can idols suffer not to indulge in coquetry and face decora-tion?“Now through your face you have bestowed love and impa-tience on reason, now through your eyes played the Messiah tothe sick;“Now with your tresses given the image of God’s cord tothe believer, now through twisted curls given a cross to theChristian.“If you have beheld your beauty which excels the sun, whyhave you withered and decayed in this dusty prison?“Why do you not become refreshed by the graces of theheart’s springtime? Why do you not laugh like the rose andpound ambergris?“Why do you not ferment like wine in the vat of this world,that the fermenting may bring you forth from this enameledlid?  “Why is your Jacob denied the lighting of your lovely face?Joseph of the lovely ones, why do you languish in the bottom ofthe well?“Behold your own beauty, ignorant one, in the light of thesouls of the Pegs \autdds\, for the believer is the mirror of thebeliever in time of loneliness.“The earth sees its secrets in the face of the garden, ‘Whatthrough its beauty and charm I have in my heart.’ “The rock sees its secret in the ruby and turquoise, ‘I have atreasure in my heart yearning to emerge.’“The dark iron sees its heart in the mirror, ‘I am recipient tolight, after all things bright.’“When nonentities see how nonentities have been changed,they come into existence to enjoy a meeting.“Would the fly have gone around to every dunghill had itknown that by effort and virtue the ‘Anqa comes out of its com-position?“When the Sufi has become ‘son of the moment,’ he doesnot become an idle person tomorrow; that person soon be-comes idle who is a fool and a procrastinator. “Sit among sweethearts if you are not immature and impo-tent; use yourself to lovers, my friend, do not wander abouteverywhere.“Fish, it has become certain to you from the sea behind yourback; turn your face round and go back, since you are a seacreature.“Hear the call of Return, go to the water of life; enter thewater and go gaily, why do you linger in water and clay?“With heart and soul you have gone to a place where neithersoul nor heart remain; on your own foot you have gone to aplace where you bite your own hand.“Become gold through the sun of eternity; go not to an-other’s gold, for love of gold makes you yellow, though yourface is silvery. “The world says to you, ‘Why have you become my slave? Af-ter all you are born of the king, it is I who should be your slave.’  “The sea says to you, ‘I shall be your steed, rather than thatyou should be my steed, acting as porter and water-carrier.’“Be silent, I was like you too, but I kept silence and foundrest; if you listen to me, you will be silent too, and find rest.”Today the king in secret visited the madmen; a shout wentup from the souls of the spiritual distracted ones.Amid the cries that king recognized my voice, for my voicehad become purified of animal breaths.He signaled so royally that the madman leaped from hisbonds; if I am mad, O king, you are the Solomon of the divs.O king, you share the secrets of the birds and the spells ofthe divs; now if it is fitting you should recite a spell on this mad-man.An elder approached the king saying, “Bind him in chains,for this madman is causing enough disturbance and disorder inthe divan .”My king said, “This madman will accept no chain other thanthe chain of my tress; you do not know his character.“He bursts thousands of bonds to fly to my hand; to us re-turning he becomes, for he is a royal falcon.”There entered the city of man a mighty torrent; the heavenswere destroyed, and a waterwheel of pure light was set turning.That city was simply madness, mankind therein distracted;for he had escaped from yesterday and tomorrow, when heawakened from a sleep.The water boiled and became a wind which caused everymountain to fly like straw before a fierce wind, hot andburning.  Having cleaved through the mountains, he revealed themines, you could see ruby on ruby shining like moonlight. In that glow you behold him, a Chinese moonface, his twohands of separation full of blood like the hands of a butcher.From the scent of the blood of his hands all the spirits aredrunk with him; all the skies abject before him — bravo, the gra-cious Giver!When he slays, it is like the trampling of grapes that throughthe perishing may become immortal, the grapes becomesyrup.Though you trample hundreds of thousands of grapes, allwill be one when such a door has been opened for the soul to-wards unification.It is necessary that Shams-i Tabriz! should take the hand ofthat soul, put the ring on his finger, bestow kingly apparatus.Fire -worshiping heart of mine who spins like a ball in thefire, say to the saki, “Quick now, a glass of lees to begin with!”Come, lip-biting saki, cook with that wine the raw ones;bravo, garden and orchard and vine from which you pressedthe grapes!I will give a hint which no one gives; the hint is this, O fairof stature, that on that night you transported me unselfed, youcommitted me over to that moonface of mine.You, reason, do you remember how, when the king of reasonout of love bestowed that fiery wine on me, at the first breathyou died? That darling brought two dishes, one of fire, one full of gold;if you take gold, it becomes fire, and if you set on fire, you winthe game.See the proud saki! Extinguish that pretty fire! What do youknow of the power of the fire, for there you are a little child?  Get out of the fire, you will rise happy out of Shams al-Din-iTabriz!; and if you flee into the gold, like gold you will havecongealed.My heart came like a pen in the fingers of the Beloved;tonight it is writing zai, tomorrow it will write mi.He trims a pen for epistolary style, copying and the rest; thepen says, “I am resigned, you know; who am I, lord?Now he blackens its face, now he rubs it in his hair; now heholds it upside down, now he uses it for a task.On one sheet he cancels a world and makes it headless;on another sheet he delivers a perilous conjunction fromcalamity.The splendor of the pen is according to the dignity ofthe scribe, whether it is in the hand of a king or a com-mander.He splits its head for the reason he knows; Galen knows bestwhat is best for the patient.That pen is unable to utter by its own reason any applause;that pen knows not of its own nature to make disapproval.Whether I call it pen or call it flag, in it is sense andsenselessness — bravo, the conscious senseless one!The mind can not compass its description, for in it is theunion of opposites, a composition without composition,amazing! — constrained yet with free will.By the right of old companionship and friendship, do notrepeat to the Beloved all that I uttered last night, unconsciousand sick;  But if, as God decrees, that moon hears of these things, hehimself knows what a melancholy lover will say in the darknessof night.When reason is not at home, the tale will be distorted — nowlow, now high, now war, now submissiveness.If God should scatter my frenzy over the world, you willnot see one man with reason; all will be stripped of theirreason. Reason, can it be that you pour these dark suggestions intome? Cloud, can it be you who rains upon me this troubledpotion?Moslems, Moslems, guard well your hearts; let none goabout me, either to sightsee or to sympathize.At dawn I said to that moon, “O I body and you soul, I amin this state that you see, and weep tor what you know.“You are beyond infidelity and faith, and drive a fast mount;what a fearless king you are! Do precisely as you are.“Just once return and pass our way, gaze on the thicket ofthe souls — behold the trees wet with blood, like branches ofcoral.”You have heard how a raw one gets a reputation amongmen, not fearing that self-will may stamp its brand on his fore-head. Do not disapprove of the pure ones; be afraid of the blow ofthe fearless ones — for the patience of the soul of the sufferingones will annihilate you utterly.You who are selfed, do not wrestle with the unselfed; youenemy of the darvishes, do not mix in fight with them with astratagem of which you are incapable;For Shams al-DTn-i Tabriz!, with life -bestowing and blood-spilling, kindles the fire to a fierceness by Divine powers. US O spiritual form, why are you fleeing from us? You are afterall of the house, you know the state of this servant.By the right of my hot tears, by the right of my pale cheeks,by the bond that I have with you beyond this human phase —Though the whole world were laughing, without you it werea prison; enough this, show compassion to this deprived pris-oner.Though I am with all my very dear ones, when you are afar Iam sore distraught — O God, may such distraction not be the lotof anyone. What shall I tie to that fleeing foot of yours so that you maynot flee? You resemble an unfaithful soul; you are fleeing likeour Beloved.Though you gallop up out of the nine spheres and set fire tothe seven seas, I will rend to pieces spheres and seas with loveand patience and strength.Even if like the sun you surmount the fourth heaven, I willstill come secretly to your stirrup like a shadow.The physician of the soul brought a tray as a present; if youare a doting old man you will become fair and youthful.It gives life to the body, intoxication to the soul; it takesaway from the heart’s slackness, from the cheeks’ pallor.That was the tray of Jesus, it became the inheritance of thephysicians; you will find in it the antidote, if you have swallowedthe poison of death.You who seek that tray, turn your face to this qibla; whenyou turn your face thither, you will become the moonfaced ofthe world.  There is a pill hidden there which touches not the teeth, nei-ther wet nor dry, neither hot nor cold.Through that pill smaller than a grain you will come to thetop of that dome, for that has become the dwelling place ofJesus; and that grain, for all its smallness,Has become a protection, and every powerless man seeksthe protection of your generosity; never will he whom you havenourished become lean.I said to the physician of the soul, “Today in thousands ofways there is a sure footing, since you have trodden firmly.”He to whom you have given a place will never be by aughtdisplaced; grief will not pare that heart which you have pared ofgrief.Be silent and hush your words now that the test has befallenyou; say farewell to pledges, you are free of those pledges.My soul, why do you tarry so long in the land of exile? Re-turn from this exile; how long will you be dispersed?I sent a hundred letters, I signaled a hundred ways; eitheryou do not know the way or you do not read the letter.If you do not read the letter, the letter itself reads you; andif you do not know the way, you are in the grip of Him whoknows the way.Return, for in this prison no one knows your worth; sit notwith the stonyhearted, for you are a gem of this mine.You who have escaped from heart and soul, washed yourhands of heart and soul, leaped forth from the snares of theworld — return, for you are one of the falcons.You are both water and stream and are seeking for water; youare both lion and deer and are better than they.How far is it from you to the Soul? Are you more remarkablethan the Soul? Are you commingled with the Soul, or a ray ofthe Beloved?  You are the light of the moon in the night, candy and sugaron the lip; dear lord, what a person you are! Dear lord, you area divine marvel!Every moment you bestow beauty and splendor, and we be-stow heart and head and soul. Such a market is very fine — yougive and take splendidly.It is of your love to take away the life, of us to die like sugar;to eat poison from your hand is the very fountain of life.Become of one hue with the community, that you may feelspiritual delight; enter the street of the tavern, that you maybehold the dregs-drinlcers.Drain the cup of passion, let it be that you become a dis-grace; close up the eyes of your head, that you may see the se-cret eye.Open your two hands if you desire an embrace; break theidol of clay, that you may see the face of the idols.How long for the sake of an old woman will you endure sucha dowry? How long for the sake of three loaves will you facesword and spear?Lo, the saki who is no tyrant, in his assembly there is acircle — enter and sit in that circle; how long will you gaze onthe circling of fate?Here is a good bargain — give a life and receive a hundred;cease to act the wolf and dog, that you may behold the shep-herd’s love.By night the Beloved goes about; do not take opiumtonight, close your mouth against food, that you may feel thetaste of the mouth.You say, “The enemy took so-and-so away from me”; go,abandon so-and-so, that you may see twenty so-and-so’s.Think of naught but the creator of thought; thought for theBeloved is better than thinking about bread.  With the breadth of God’s earth why have you clung toprison? Knot care less, that you may see the expanse of Paradise.Silence this speech, that you may gain speech one day; passaway from the soul and the world, that you may behold theSoul of the world.You imprisoned in air nine spheres of emerald till youbrought into orbit a form of earth.Water, what are you washing? Wind, what are you seeking?Thunder, why are you roaring? Spheres, why are you turning?Love, why are you laughing? Reason, why are you binding?Patience, why are you content? Face, why are you pale?What place is there for the head on the road of fidelity? Whatworth has life itself in the religion of manliness?That man is perfect in quality who is the quarry of annihila-tion; there is room tor not one hair in the circle of uniqueness.Whether anguish or joy, it is far from freedom; cold is thatperson who remains in hotness and coldness.Where is the gleam of the charming brow if you have seenmy moon? Where is the gleam of drunkness if you have drunkspiritual wine?Has not disquietude from this purse and that bowl seizedyou? After all you are not a blind ass; what are you circlingaround?With the breast unwashed what profits it to wash the face?From greed you are like a broom, you are always in this dust.Every day for me is Friday, and this sermon of mine is per-petual; this pulpit of mine is high, my screen is true manliness.When the steps of this pulpit become empty of men, the spir-its and the angels will bring a present from God.  Garden, do you know in whose wind you are dancing? Youare pregnant with fruit, intoxicated with the rose bower.Why do you possess this spirit, if you are this body? Why doyou paint this image, if you are all soul?What offering is life to you? Dates brought to Basra! Howcan I speak of you as a pearl, since you are the envy of Oman?Reason, wag your chin this wise by your own analogy;what do you know of that wise, being fascinated by humanchins? It is difficult to play the lute for the deaf, or to sprinkle sugarover the head of one suffering from the bile.Faith borrows a hundred eyes to see him, until faith becomesdrunk with that wine divine.I fall at the foot of the heart; every day I say, “Your secretwill be hidden unless you cause it to leap forth.”That six-sided dice is appropriate to that checkerboard; howshall the human dice be contained in any bowl?Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz!, why do I return every instant toyour hand, if you are not the king?How happy the day when you return from the road andshine in the window of the soul like the moon from above!With that moon ever-waxing, devoid of all ornaments, youwill adorn like the empyrean this earthly floor.Many a fettered man of reason, who is escaped out of self;many a soul, which begins anew the rule of sugar-cracking,Many a caravan without mount and provision will find,out of this six-cornered abode, the road into the placelessworld.  Illuminate my soul, so that my soul says to my body, “Todayregard me, you master of tomorrow!”You are water, I am a stream; how should I seek to join you?The stream has no luster if you do not open the water.You who are happy with being before — that is, being morethan all; by Allah, so long as you are with self, you will not findrepose from self.I was seeking the heart; on the road I saw it fallen intothis melancholy passion, itself like a man suffering from thebile.Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz!, your separation has filtered me;you will see nothing but love, though you filter me a hundredtimes.If the knowledge of the tavern were your intimate compan-ion, this formal knowledge and science would be mere windand caprice in your eyes;And if the bird of the unseen cast its shadow upon you, theSimorg of the world would be but a fly in your sight.If the concourse-splendor of the king of reality displayeditself, this drum of the kings would be for you a jinglingbell.If the dawn of true felicity showed favor to you, how wouldyour skirt and beard be in the hand of the night patrol? If the leaders cast their protection on you, the thought that isbefore the heart would be behind.If your heart’s ear did not hear things contrariwise, one letterof the book oflovers would be enough.He says, “All are dead, not one has returned”; if that foolsaw one who had returned, he would be a somebody.The flame of your soul is trembling at the cold wind ofdeath; it would not be trembling if it had borrowed fire fromimmortality.  If your worthless nature were not a fellow traveler of theworthless, this fatal draft would be in your throat like a chokingstraw.This child of your intelligence would have reached “ Blessedis He”; in the school of happiness why are you stuck at “ hefrowned ?”Silence, for all these things are dependent on the “moment”;if the “moment” were here, summons would come to youraid.Become a lover, become a lover and bid groaning begone; you are after all a king’s son, how long will you be aprisoner?To the king’s son, the commandership and vizierate is all adisgrace; beware that you take nothing but love.That one is not the commander of death, he is the prisonerof death; the whole passion for viziership is naught but a bore-dom.If you are not a picture on the bath, seek after the spirit; solong as you are in love with form, whence will you receive spirit?Do not mingle with dust, for you are a pure essence; do notmingle with vinegar, for you are sugar and milk.Though on this side people do not recognize you, on thatside where side is not, how matchless and incomparable youare!This world is death, and in this perishing world if you are nota prince, is it not enough that you do not die?You are the lion of God in the form of man; that is evident inyour attack and stateliness and courage.Since I saw your learning and station and graces, I have be-come indifferent to the learning of the Maqdmdt of Hariri.This life has become untimely; but since you exist in the lightof God, what matters timely or late?  The measure of the beloved is the glory of the lover; helplesslover, behold of what grandeur are you and I.The beauty of the moth is according to the measure of thecandle; after all, are you not a moth of this light-living candle?Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz, this is why you are invisible, be-cause you are the very source of sight, or the essence eye ofthe All-Seeing.I found in my house a token of the king, a ring of ruby and abelt particular of the mine.Last night I was asleep and he came, that heart-comfortingking and spiritual confidant.Last night my king broke two hundred cups and pots inrowdy, drunken fashion in the manner you know about.You might say that out of drunkenness he chose my rook, formy rook is engaged on a secret business of the king.Today the scent of the beautiful one is in this house, fromthis scent in every corner a beauty is visible.The blood in my body is pure wine from that scent; everyhair of me is a drunken pitch-black Hindu.Give ear and listen to the drunken shout, these melodies ofsong from my lute like stature.Fire, wine and tent are as cash; the elders of the path receivetheir youth.In the mirror of Shams-i Haqq va Din, King of Tabriz; boththe form of the whole is published and the sea of realities.I grant that you do not see the face of that Chinese girl;do you not see the moving of this veil proceeds from hermoving?  Through the luster of that moon which is hidden in theskies, you have seen a hundred moons in earthly particles.O leaf, scattered in the contrary wind, if you do not see thewind, do you not see that you are so?If the wind is not stirred by thought, you do not stir; and ifthat wind does not sit still, you do not sit still. The empyrean, heaven and spirit in this revolution of statesare camels in hie, and you are the hindermost.Move upon yourself and drink of this blood, for in the wombof heaven you are a fetus-child.In the sphere of your heart suddenly a pain arises; if youraise your head from the sphere, you know that you are notthis.Your ninth month is the face of Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz,O you who are the trustee of the trust of both worlds.O heart, be patient in this blood until the ninth month; youare that month moon, O king, tor you are Shams al-Haqqva Din.Heart, since you have become understanding of the myster-ies, you have become useless tor all other employments.Be still mad and insane; why have you come to your sensesand recovered your wits?Meditation is all tor the sake of acquiring; you have becomeentirely giving.Preserve that same order of Majnun, tor you have becomeindifferent to all orderings. If you desired to be veiled and prudent, why did you goabout drunk in the market?To sit in a corner yields you no profit once you have becomethe friend of the dissolutes of this path.Go forth into the desert, that same desert where you were;you have wandered long enough in these ruins.  There is a tavern in your neighborhood, from the scent of itswine you have become intoxicated;Seize this scent and go to the tavern, for you have becomenimble -paced as that scent.Go to the mountain of Qaf like the Simurgh; why have youbecome the friend of owl and heron?Go like a lion into the thicket of reality; why have you be-come the friend of tox and hyena?Go not after the scent of the shirt of Joseph, for like Jacobyou are in mourning.No interpreter of our fires, not tongue for the secrets of ourhearts —Heart and love have become naked of one hundred veils,soul and soul seated two and two —If Gabriel himself would enter between the two, he wouldnot have one moment’s security from the fire.Every instant union upon union, on every side vision uponvision,You see on the roof of which kings of reality you are seatedas a watchman.The end of the thread of union with God is the Mount ofSinai which cannot endure this light tor a single moment.If you were to knot together a hundred universal reasons,there would be no ladder tor this tall roof;If I utter a sign of that signless one, the signs of all true menwould bow prostrated.This word has become tor you a present from that lightwhich transcends the reach of words.Words have become a belt tor Shams-i Tabriz; come, fastenit on, if you have a waist.  You have flown from this narrow cage, you have escapedfrom this prison of cutpurses.You have removed dust from the mirror, you have seen onthe mirror what you have seen.You have heard reports of low and high; seen on high whatyou have heard.Since you have committed water and clay to water and clay,you have carried the fabric of spirit to heaven.You have leaped out of the revolutions of the body, you havereached the spiritual revolutions.You have emerged out from the mother’s womb that is thisworld, you have run to the intelligent father.Every moment drink wine sweeter than life in exchange forevery bitterness you have quaffed for our sake.Choose and seize whatever you desire, since you have chosenus above all the world.You have gone forth from the cooking pot of this world likesweetmeat, because you are now cooked for the table of thatworld.Though the egg has become empty of your bird, you haveflown beyond the egg of the world.Hereafter you are not contained in this world, fly on yonder,for every moment you are augmenting.Silence! Depart, for your lock has been opened; death hasdirected the key to your lock.iMay these nuptials be blessed for us, may this marriage beblessed for us;May it be ever like milk and sugar, this marriage like wineand halvah.  May this marriage be blessed with leaves and fruits like thedate tree;May this marriage be laughing forever, today, tomorrow, likethe houris of paradise. May this marriage be the sign of compassion and the ap-proval of happiness here and hereafter;May this marriage be fair of fame, fair of face, fair of omen asthe moon in the azure sky.I have fallen silent, for words cannot describe how the spirithas mingled with this marriage.Ho, water of life, turn me about like a mill with plenty.So continue, that forever and ever my scattered heart may bein one place, I in another.Twig and leaf move not save by a wind; straw-blade flies notwithout amber.Since a straw moves not save by a wind, how shall the worldmove without desire? All the parts of the world are lovers, and every part of theuniverse is drunk with encounter;Only they do not tell you their secrets — it is not proper totell the secret save to one worthy.The grazers, whose pasture grazes on the cup and table ofthe sweet lord.Did not the ants tell their secret to Solomon, did not themountain echo back to David?Were this heaven not a lover, his breast would not be serene; And if the sun had not been a lover, there would be no radi-ance in his beauty.If earth and mountain were not lovers, no blade of grasswould spring from their breasts;If the sea were not aware oflove, it would finally come torest somewhere .  Be a lover, that you may know the lover; be faithful, that youmay see the Faithful.Heaven did not accept the burden of trust, for it was in loveand afraid to make a mistake.I heard that you praised your servant — who am I? You haveshown yourself such kindness.You are the ruby-mine, the soul of amber; in compassion youravished a blade of straw.I was a worthless and valueless piece of iron; you polishedme, made me a mirror.You ransomed me from the flood of extinction, for you areboth Noah and the Ark of Judi.Heart, if you have burned, give scent like aloewood; if youare raw, then burn now, for you are firewood.I slept under the shadow of fortune; you opened a way forme beside the five senses.On that road it is possible to go to east and west, withoutfeather, without head or foot.On that road is no thorn of free will; no Christian is there,no Jew.The soul, beyond the circumference of its blue sky, is es-caped from blueness and blindness.Why do you weep? Go to the laughing ones. Why do youtarry? Go to the same place where you once were.From this honey, which has a hundred kinds of sting, hasanything increased except boils? i In body you are with us, in heart you are in the meadow; youare the quarry yourself when attached to the hunt.You are girdled here in the body like a reed, inwardly you arelike a restless wind.Your body is like the diver’s clothes on the shore; you like afish, your course is in the water.In this sea are many bright veins, many veins too that aredark and black; The brightness of the heart derives from those bright veins;you will discern them when you lift your wings.In those veins you are hidden like the blood, and if I lay afinger, you are shy.From those veins the voice of the sweet-veined lute is melan-choly, reflecting the grace of that melancholy.Those melodies come from the shoreless sea which thunderslike waves out of the infinite.The springtide brings me into laughter, a hangover keeps meheadspinning.A moon has brought me into the circle, a friend has mademe friendless.I have become as a string through the voice of a lute — themelody is audible, the string is invisible.Like dust he stirred up the world; he has vanished like a windin a dust. That king lit up life like a spark who vanished in a spark as ifburning.That one adorned the beauty of the rose garden who van-ished like a rose in the soul of a thorn.  My heart says, “Tell the saki my soul is drunk at least tor thatremaining one.”My heart like a mirror is silent, speaking in the hand of anamazing mirror-holder;From whom moment by moment there shines in the mirroran amazing figure of beauty.Every form is as the Sultan’s falcon; itself a quarry, it seeks aquarry.Do you not seek a sign of the separated ones? Where hasgone that fidelity and affection?The fishes are on this dry land of exile: come, water of the seaof life!How long shall the fish remain out of its water? What am I tosay? I do not know; you know.Who am I to remain or not to remain? I desire you to remainin the world.Let thousands of souls like me and better than me be yoursacrifice, for you are the soul of the soul of the soul.You say to me, “Be silent — have you not repented that youare leaving the road of tonguelessness?”By the dust of your feet, I was not with myself out of drunk-enness and wine and dizziness.I am no better in silence than a vat; the wine does not remainhidden in the vat.The wine of love is a more bubbling wine, for ordinary winebubbles tor a moment and this is ever-bubbling.His lace, red as the Judas blossom, does that which only ahundred jars of Judas-red wine can do.I could describe his lips further but your mouth would burnif you were to recite it.A strange waterfowl is the lover’s soul, bringing water as apresent from fire;  Through fire, athirst, he discovered the joy of his water; firemakes a ladder to his water.Where are you, martyrs divine, affliction-seekers of the plainof Karbala?Where are you, light-spirited lovers, speedier on wing thanthe birds of the air?Where are you, celestial kings who know how to openheaven’s gate?Where are you, escaped from life and place? How can anyonetell reason, “Where are you?”Where are you, you who have broken the door of the prisonand set the debtors free?Where are you, you who have opened the door of the store-house? Where are you, help of the helpless?You are in that sea whereof the world is the foam; swim awhile more.The forms of this world are the foam of that sea; leave thefoam, if you are of the people of purity.My heart foamed, which took the shape of words; let go theform and go take the heart, if you are of us.Shams-i TabrizI, rise out of the east, for you are the source ofthe source of the source of every radiance.Out of drunkenness and dissolution I have become such thatI do not know earth from water.I do not find anyone in this house — you are sober; come,perhaps you will find.I only know that the assembly was set up first by you; I donot know if you are wine or lcabob.  + Inwardly you are the soul of the soul of the soul, outwardlyyou are the sun of the sun. You are sweet-enchanting for you are the Messiah; you burnup divs for you are a meteor.Make me happy-tempered, for you are wine; make me sweet-smelling tor you are rose-water.You are the zephyr, for you make the garden to laugh,though to the thirsty you are torture.Come, see the numerous drunkards in the bazaar, if you area bailiff and making a census.Like beggars tor bread now questioning, like sufferers nowresponding.io Your smile is brief as a lightning flash, so you are a prisonerin the shadows of the clouds.Enter the assembly of the Eternal king; behold circulatingthe porringers like water troughs.You are a lovely ruby, but you are in the mine; you are verybeautiful, but you are in the veil.If to the king you fly, you are the white falcon; if to thegraveyard you fly, you are the raven.Youthful of fortune, clap hands and say, “Youth, O youth,O youth!” Say no word to anyone, if he presses you hard; only say,“God knows best what is right.”The garden is here, springtime, and the tall cypress — we willnot go back from these surroundings.Open the veil and close the door; here are we, you and I, andthe empty house.Today I am the special companion oflove, having seized thecup of I-do-not-care.Minstrel sweet of melody, sweet of reed, you must lamentmighty sweetly.  Said, joyous and happy, bring the wine forward immedi-atelyThat we may drink happily and sleep sweetly in the shadowof eternal grace —Drink not by way of throat and stomach, sleep not as theresult of nights.O heart, I desire you to rub that cup upon your eyes;When you become completely annihilated in the wine, thathour you are perfect existence.You will remain constant from Hejjave them to drink, with-out death and annihilation and transfer.Give up thievishness, and go around happily, secure from thegovernor’s tortures.You say, “Show where security is”; go, go, for still you arequestioning!O day of such happiness, what day are you? O day, you arebetter than a thousand years.All days are your slaves; they are separation, you are union.O day, who shall behold your beauty? O day, you aretremendous in beauty.You behold your own beauty, and that eye whose ear youbox!O day, you are not day from the sun; you are day throughthe light of the All-Glorious.Every evening the sun prostrates itself; it begs for quittanceof your moon.O day, hidden in the middle of the day, O day, you abideeternally. daily bread of days and nights, O gendeness of north andsouth winds, will be silent from speaking of perfection, for you are be-yond every perfection.You become not manifest in words, for you are more mani-fest than all discourse;By words spoken thoughts become manifest — you are aboveimagination and thought,  And that imagination and thought are athirst tor you, youwho have given smoothness to water.Both of these are dry-mouthed in the water of spirit; in theworld full, of self empty.The rest of the ode is veiled from you behind the curtain, toryou are aweary.When you are aiming at brotherhood, first of all you mustwash your face;If your head is splitting with drunkenness, do not seek tosplit the heads of your brothers.Either drive away the smell of your armpits, or say farewell tothe beloved’s embrace.In the feast of a moon with hyacinth tresses how should it beetiquette for you to lament?You want a quarry without a snare; be sure that like me youare seeking the impossible.If your ears are hot from drunkenness, you are a Sufi of theconcert of riotous ecstasy.If your mind is unconscious of your ears, you are not single,you are a thousandfold.The assembly is like a lamp, and you are like water; the lampis ruined by water.The sun has shone upon the gathering; depart from themidst, for you are as a cloud.Sit not at the table, for you are raw; where is the smell ofkabob, if you are lcabob?You went ahead, saying, “I am the chamberlain”; by Allah,you are not the chamberlain, you are the curtain.  Since chamberlains of doors have indications, they know towhat door you belong.You are mounted on a wooden horse and stupidly rush tothe charge.Either choose love, which is triple cash-in-hand, or chooseabstinence, if you seek after the reward.Sit and rise with the wakeful ones, for this caravan has de-parted and you are asleep.Through Shams al-DIn you will arrive at the stage, and inTabriz you will find the way.Union with you is the source of happiness, for those are butforms and this is reality.Break not for a moment from your servant, for a ship cannotsail without water.I am a faulty Koran but am made correct when you recite.A Joseph alone, and a hundred wolves, yet he escapes whenyou are shepherd. Every time you ask me, “EIow are you?” I am with tears andpale cheeks.For the vulgar these two are tokens; what are signs to youwho are without sign?Unspoken you hear the discourse, unwritten you read thedeed.Without sleep you show visions, without water you drive onthe ships.Silence, have done with praises and petitions, for from theunseen has come thou shall not see me.  I said to my heart, “Why are you thus? How long will youconsort with love?”The heart said, “Why do you not also come to experiencethe delights of love?”Even if you know the water of life, how shall you chooseaught but the fire of love?You in subtlety have become as the wind, you are full of wineas the bumper glass.Like water, you give life to images; like a mirror, you are atrustee of beauty.Every mean soul that has not those properties may think thatyou are the same —O you who are the soul of heaven, even though in form youare of earth.O fine-crumbled as surmeh , you are the surmeh of the eye ofcertainty.O ruby, of which mine are you? Enter the ring, for you are afine signet.A thousand compassions are ashamed before you the mo-ment you are full of wrath as a sword.Shams-i Tabriz, your form is lovely, and what a sweet sourceyou are in meaning!Bird of heart, fly not save in the air of selflessness; candle ofsoul, shine not save in the palace of selflessness.May the sun of God’s grace ever shine upon lovers, sothat the shadow of the phoenix of selflessness may fail uponall.Though a lover may behold myriad fortunes and comforts,naught enters his vision save the calamity of selflessness.  Look upon me, who have cast myself into affliction for thesweetnesses I have experienced in the nonentity of selflessness. What a life, what a hundred lives indeed, if a man shouldsacrifice them in desire for selflessness and for the sake of self-lessness.Lover, sit not with sorrowful ones, lest dust should fall onthe joy of selflessness.Use cruelly anyone who is a lover of prudence that you mayfind new pleasures in the faithfulness of selflessness.When you know selflessness, leadership loses its market foryou; head and leadership are as the dust of the foot of selfless-ness.It is pleasant to get visibly on the throne of kingship overone’s enemies, but these things have no worth in comparisonwith selflessness.io If you wish that Shams-i Tabriz should be your guest, emptyyour house of self, O landlord of selflessness.You who let a garden go for the sake of a small fig, let slipthe houri for the sake of an unworthy crone.I am rending my shirt, and repulsion comes over me fromthe glance that a crone cast at a youth.A stinking-mouthed crone with a hundred clutching talonsand tricks, putting her head down from the roof to snare aclever one.Who is such a crone? A savorless deception, fold on fold likean onion, fetid as garlic. A prince has become her captive, pledged his belt — shelaughs in secret, “Fool of a princeling!”No fresh blossom in the garden of her beauty, no milk in thebreasts of fidelity of that whore.When death opens your eyes, then you will behold her, herface like the back of a lizard, her body black as pitch.  No, be silent, give no more counsel. The master’s bond isvery strong; the chain of his love draws without the help of amiserable chain.Proclaim, O crier, at the head of every market, “Have youseen, Moslems, a runaway slave?“A slave moonfaced, music-scented, a troublemaker — swift ofpace in time of coquetry, in time of peace slow.“A boy, ruby-robed, charming of countenance, sugar-sweet,cypress-stature, saucy-eyed, acute, perfectly poised;“In his bosom a rebec, in his hand a pluclcer; he plays a sweetair, charming, well-seated.“Does anyone have a fruit of the garden of his beauty?Or a bunch of roses to smell from the rose bed of his loveli-ness?“A Joseph by whose price the king of Egypt was bankrupted,on every side heart-wounded ones like Jacob by his glance.“I will give freely my sweet life as lawful to whomever bringsme a sign of him, or even a veiled hint.”“Ah, from those lightning-casting, sweet, mischievouscheeks! A thunderbolt from its lightning has fallen on the soulof every helpless one ! ”When before the row of pearls and rubies shone like fire, asea of pearls surged out of the rock.This heart torn into a hundred pieces gave a piece to thedoorkeeper of the soul; when he emerged in the heart of thecurtain, it became a better piece.Paradise is divided into eight heavens, and one like a scroll;behold the eight scrolls contained in a sheet of a cheek.  What kind of bird is this heart of mine, kneeling like a camel,or fire-eating like an ostrich around a blaze!Quarry of joy, this heart of mine shared the same shop withyour love; it found a fine colleague and fellow- worker in thatshop.Through the sun of your love, the motes of the souls havebecome like the moon, and every moment a star of felicitycomes into the sky.Your form is invisible, yet relates every detail — like theMessiah through the light of Mary, the spirit of God in thecradle.Shams-i TabrizI, what inconsistency is there in the heart’sstates, at once abiding in love and fugitive from love?Soul of a hundred rose gardens, you have vanished fromjasmine; soul of the soul of my soul, why have you vanishedfrom me?Since heaven through you is resplendent, what is veiled toyou? Since the body through you is living, how have you van-ished from the body?Out of the perfection of God’s jealousy and the loveliness ofyour beauty, O king of men, you have thus vanished from menand women.Candle of the nine skies, for you have passed through thenine skies, what secret is this, that you have vanished in thecandleholder? O Canopus, before whose face the sun fainted, it is good, itis good that you have vanished from Yemen.Musk of Tartary makes a sign to mankind with every breathbecause you are the king of Cathay and have vanished fromKhotan.What wonder, if you vanish from us and the two worlds, Oselfless moon that has vanished from self?

The cause of your jealousy is that you are hidden, otherwiseyou are evident as the sun, for you are manifest through everymote.If you choose to be in a corner, you are darling of the heartand a prince; and if you rend the veil, you have rent the veils ofall.The heart of unbelief by you is confounded, the heart of faithby your wine is happy; you have robbed all of their sense, youhave pulled the ears of all.All roses are a prey to December, all heads in pawn to wine;you have redeemed both these and those from the hand ofdeath.Since there is no constancy in the rose, since there is no wayto the rose, on you only is trust to be put; you are the stay andsupport.If a few have cut their hands on account of Joseph’s face, youhave deprived two hundred Josephs of the spirit of heart andreason.You fashion the form of a person from filth and blood, thathe may flee two parsangs from the odor of foulness.You make him a morsel of dust to become pure herbage — heescapes from foulness when you have breathed spirit into him.Come, heart, go to heaven, go to God’s pasture, since youhave grazed awhile in the pasture of cattle .Set all your desire on that of which you have no hope, forout of original hopelessness you have reached thus far.Be silent, that the lord who bestows words may speak; forHe made the door and the lock, and He also made a key.Tidings are newly arrived — do you perhaps have no news ofit? The envious heart has turned to blood; perhaps you have noheart.  The moon has shown his face, opened the wings of light;borrow a heart and eyes from someone if you do not have any.Amazing, night and day a flying arrow comes from the hid-den bow; yield your life to this arrow. What can you do? Youhave no shield.Has not the copper of your being been changed, like Moses,to gold by His alchemy? What care? Though you have no goldin your bag like Korah?Within you is an Egypt whose sugarcane bed you are; whatcare, though you have no supply of sugar from without?You have become the slave of fc>rm, like the idol-worshipers;you are like Joseph, but within you do not gaze.By God, when you see your own beauty in the mirror youwill be your own idol, you will not pass over to anyone.O Reason, are you not unjust to call him like the moon? Whydo you call him moon? Perhaps you have no sight.Your head is like a lamp containing six wicks; from what areall six alight, if you have not that spark?Your body is like a camel which travels to the Kaaba of theheart; out of assishness you have not gone on the pilgrimage,not because you have no ass.If you have not gone to the Kaaba, felicity will draw you on;do not flee, idler, tor you have no means of passing from God.Ho, watchman of the dwelling, what sort of watchman areyou? For the night-thief secretly carries off all our baggage.Throw cold water on your face, rise up and make a tumult,tor because of your sleepiness all our profit has been turned toloss.Night and the sleep of watchmen are a thief s lamp; why doyou not extinguish their lamp with a breath?Give over being idle; be a night-traveler like the stars. Whatdo you fear of earthly beings, since you are a celestial rider?  Two or three barks of a dog do not cut off the road to horse-men; what shall a dog or a hay-fed ox snatch from a fierce lion?What effect have the dog of wrath and the ox of lust on alion who rends asunder the ranks of vision in the thicket of real-ities?Were you not two drops of water, that now you make anark and a Noah to run to left and right midst the waves of theflood?Since God is your protection, what peril threatens the roadfor you? Your cap reaches the sky, for you are the head of allheads.What an excellent path it is, with God as companion; thehard journey would become like eternal Paradise.Do not say, “What present shall I bring as a token?” Theirown face is enough as a present to the sun and moon.Whether you go or not, your felicity is running, dischargingall the business in tranquillity and love.When fortune is your slave it does you a thousand services,for it cannot do without you, even though you drive it from thedoor.Sleep sweetly, tor luck does not sleep on your account; take astone in your hand, tor it will become a ruby of the mine.Mount heaven like Jesus; say, let me see like Moses, for Godwill not say to you, “Silence, thou shall not see Me.”Silence, O heart; yet what use, if you block the lid of the jar?The heart of the vat will split when those truths ferment.Every moment two thousand times you will recite this poem,if you realize how it travels beyond realities.O idol, you are so subtle that you enter into our soul; O idol,by the right of your grace, pray enter amongst us.You possess the true world, you have not your home onearth; what would it be if for a time you entered our world?  You are subtle and without mark, you are hidden even fromthe hidden; this hiddenness of mine shines forth when you en-ter our hidden part.Since you possess the speech of all birds, Solomon, whathoney you impart to the lip when you enter our tongue! In the world you alone are king, no one draws your bow; Iwill fly like an arrow if you enter our bow.Parade forth, Shams-i Tabriz, for you are the touchstone ofGod; all our copper turns to gold when you enter our mine.You have the attribute of God; when you enter any breast,you display from that breast the glow of Mount Sinai.You have the attribute of a lamp; when you enter a houseby night, all the house receives light from the splendor of yourbrightness.You have the attribute of wine; when you are in an assem-bly you kindle two thousand tumults and riots with your sweetgraciousness.When joy is fled, when passion is flown, what grasses androses grow when you sweetly act the water-carrier! When the world is frozen, when gaiety is dead, what otherworlds you open out of the unseen!From you comes this importunity in the heart of the restlessones; otherwise what acquaintance would dark earth have withbrightness?You are the sky about the earth revolving night and day; Osky, what do you want of us? Are you not the source of all light?Now you scatter rain, now you sift the earth; you are not aseeker of filings, after all, you are all mine and touchstone.Like men seeking filings night and day you sift the earth; whydo you worship earth? Are you not the qibla of all prayers? What wonder if a beggar seeks a gift from a king? This is thewonder — that a king begs from a beggar.  Even more amazing is this — the king has gone so far in peti-tion that the beggar falls into error and thinks he is king.Sky, are you not king? Is not the earth your slave? Then whyare you in the air night and day serving the earth?The sky answers me, “No one moves without reason; if astraw flies, that is due to some amber.”My words are meat to the angels; if I speak no words, thehungry angels say, “Speak, why are you silent?”You are not of the angels, what do you know of angels’ food?What should you make of manna? You deserve chives.What do you know of this pottage that comes from thekitchen of the brain, where God acts the householder nightand day? Tabriz, say to Shams al-DIn, “Turn your face to us.” Ierr — say, “O sun, all face without a back!”My idol scolds, saying, “Why have you fallen in the middle ofthe road?” Idol, why should I not fall from such a wine as youhave given me?Idol, I fell in suchwise that even at the resurrection I shallnot rise, when you held such a cup and uncovered such a flask.I am dissolute, yet I have a little understanding, for you tookup my head and placed it in your bosom.Idol, from your drunken eye which is the wine-holder oflove, you give wine without a cup — what a mighty master youare!It is of your generosity, too, that the wine has swept away myreason, for if it still kept its reason, it should burst with happi-ness.You gave me a bowl so that I am clapping my hands, for withone cup I escaped from one thousand undesirable things.By your two ravishing drunken eyes from which joy wasborn, you are the primal spirit, for you were not born of anyman.  Since it has become certain to my heart that you are the soulof the soul of the soul, open the door of grace, tor you are thestay of a hundred worlds.When separation has become rebellious, you sweetly smite itsneck in retribution tor your lovers, for you are the sword of theage.When union has become lean, nourish it with the goblet;everything before you attains nourishment gratis.Your sun has at last entered Aries in felicity, for the ancientworld discovers from you the glow of youth. What concerts are in the soul, what flagons pouring, whichare reaching the ear from that tambourine and harp andsongs!How full is this rose bower with the song of the nightingale,so that from the riotous shouts of the drunkards you cannot tellwine from bowl.All the branches are in flower, the kings have seized thecup; all have departed out of themselves through the heavenlywine.Convey my soul’s greetings to those kings, but you will notfind anyone sober to convey my greetings to them.The gnat has quaffed wine and lost its head and beardfeather, and annihilated Nimrod with a dagger,io If the wine does this to a gnat, say, what will it do to an ele-phant? What shall I do? The wine of placeless land cannot bedescribed.From his life-granting wine the dog of the cave is his lion-seizer which does nothing but act the shepherd around thecavern of the drunkards.If a dog has become so beside itself, consider what the raginglion, when it is faithful, discovers from the wine of those vessels.Tabriz has become an East through the rising of Shams al-Dln, for sparks reach the stars of spiritual truths from him.  Go, love, for you have become the most perfect of the lovelyones; you have smitten the necks of penitence and the penitent.What can one rely upon with your love? — for you are sucha thunderbolt. Who can associate with you? — for you are allbrawling.Neither earth nor heaven can stand or withstand you; you arenot in these six directions, so whence have you come?The eight paradises are in love with you; how beautiful is yourface! The seven hells tremble at you; what a fire temple you are! Hell says to you, “Pass, for I cannot endure you.” You arethe Paradise of Paradise and were the Hell of Hell.Lovers’ eyes are wet on their skirts because of your sweeteyes; you are the provocation and brigand of every ascetic manand woman.To be without you in the cloister is nothing but madness, foryou are the very life of the cloister and temple.Give justice to my ruined heart, O judge of love! — for youhave taken tribute from my ruined village.Simple heart of mine, from whom do you seek justice? It islawful to love to shed blood, if you are of this guild,io Justice for lovers is beyond the bounds of the soul; you areengaged in useless thought and fancy.Only the angels’ attributes are privy to love for sure; you area prisoner of the attributes of donkey and div and wild beast.Enough, practice not magic; first deliver yourself, for you arethe prisoner of the passion for magic and jugglery.Gaze on the cheeks of love that you may gain the attributesof true men; sit not with the cold ones so you will not be chilledby their breath.  From the cheeks of love seek something other than the form;your business is to be a fellow sufferer with love.If you have the attributes of a clod, you will never fly in theair; you will fly in the air if you break to pieces and become dust.If you do not break to pieces, he who composed you willbreak you; when death breaks you, how will you become aunique pearl? When a leaf becomes yellow, the fresh root makes it green;why are you content with a love from which you turn yellow?Go, nimble-rising soul go on a strange journey to the sea ofmeanings, for you are a precious pearl.If you remember, you have passed through water and clay;do not be vexed that you are passing from this terrace too.Wash your wings of this water and clay, and become lightand nimble; what are you doing not to fly in the wake of yourfriends who have flown?Ho, break the pitcher and enter the river, O water of life;before every pitcher- breaker how long will you be the potter? From this mountaintop go like a torrent towards the sea, forthis mountain to no one’s body offers an abiding-place.Enough, cut not away from the Sun either to East or West,for through him you are now a crescent, now as a moon at thefull.By the right and sanctity of that, that you are the soul of allmen, fill a cup with that whose description you know well.Turn everything upside down, leave neither up nor down, sothat men may know that today you are in this maidan {arena,square}.  Strike the fire of wine in the chattel of shyness and shame;the drunkards’ hearts are weary of secret joy.The time has come for you to bring back to us that departedheart, that you should set aflying our reasons like young doves. You are speaking subtleties in the ring of dissolute drunkards;it is fine when the treasure shines out in a ruin.Circumambulate the fermented wine among these consumedones; place before the raw ones that fricassee and eggplant con-coction.What has become of me? You tell me, for how should I knowwhat has become of me, your lips utter those words so easily.With such a gait, when will you reach the station? With sucha habit, how will you gain the goal?You are very heavy of soul and camel-hearted; how will youarrive among the nimble-spirited?With such grossness how will you be modest? With sucha joining attachment for the world, how will you reach thejoiner?Since there is no opening (readiness) in your head, how willyou achieve the solving of the difficult secret? You are like water left in this clay; so how will you attain thepure from water and clay?Disregard the sun and moon like Abraham, else how will youattain the perfect sun?Since you are weak, go, flee to the grace of God, for withoutthe Gracious how will you attain the excellence?Without the tender care of that sea of loving kindness, howwill you reach the shore of such a wave?Without the Buraq oflove and the labor of Gabriel how willyou like Muhammad attain all the stages? You take shelter in those who are without shelter; how willyou attain the shelter of the welcoming king?  Before bismillah sacrifice yourself utterly; else, when you liedead, how will you attain the Name of God?Once more you have resolved to go, once more you havemade your heart like iron.No, do not extinguish the lamp of our friendship; you havepoured oil into our lamp.By Allah, you have filled this world with rose and eglantineand lily of your own face.By Allah, let no enemy say you are a friend who did the en-emy’s work. By Allah, keep your servants together, you who have bright-ened the world.Once more you are laying on one side the love -plays you didwith me.By Allah, you have purified the skirt of the evil spirit by thescatter of your sleeves.Mine of goldminters, Salah al-DIn, like the moon you havemade a harvest of silver.O, you who have shaken a whole world, the voice of thereed, the voice of the reed, the voice of the reed.What is the reed? To that beloved of the sweet kiss the placeto kiss, the place to kiss, the place to kiss.That reed without hand and foot fetches from men hand andfoot, hand and foot, hand and foot.The reed is a pretext; this is not the responsibility of the reed,this is nothing but the sound of the wing of that phoenix. God Himself it is; what is all this veil? It is drawing thepeople of God to God.  We are beggars, God is the All-Sufficient ; know, what you seeof the beggar is due to the rich.We are all darkness and God the light: from the sun came therays of this abode.Since the light in the house is mingled with shadow, if youdesire the light, come out of the house to the roof.Now you are happy, now depressed; if you do not want adepressed heart, depart out of this depression.You are putting me on trial; O love, you know my weakness,yet you go on doing so.You are becoming the interpreter of the enemy’s secret; youimplant mistaken thoughts in his heart.You are setting fire to the thicket, and at the same time utter-ing complaints.It may be thought that you have been cruelly wronged, youare making uproar and complaint like the weak.You are the sun — who will oppress you? You do whateveryou desire from on high.You make us envious of one another; you make our quarrel-ing into a fine spectacle.To the gnostics you give wine as cash-in-hand; the asceticsyou make drunk with tomorrow.You give sorrow to the death-meditating bird; the bolbolsyou make drunk and singing.You make the raven desirous of dung; your parrot you makesugar-cracking.The one you draw into mine and mountain, the other youset face to the sea.You lead us to happiness by way of suffering, or else yourecompense our slip.In this sea all is profit and justice; you dispense all benefi-cence and kindness.  This is the head of the subtlety; you speak its end, thoughyou make us be without foot and head.Welcome, melody — you are that melody which has broughta sign from the spiritual world.Pass by the ear and strike upon our souls, lor you are the lifeof this dead world.Ravish the soul and go aloft into that world where you havecarried the heart.Your laughing moon bears evidence that you have quaffedthat heavenly wine. Your sweet soul gives a sign that you were nourished inhoney from Alast.Blades have begun to sprout from the earth to show the sow-ings that you have made.You are both candle and fair one and wine, likewise spring inthe midst of December.Every side through love of you is one with feathers ablaze,the sun, and myriads like him.Since your fire always falls upon the reed, sugar has gonethrough this passion into the soul of the reed.You have beheaded myriads with love so that the soul hasnot the strength to say, “Ah, alas!” The lovers have built from the evil of the eye undergroundhouses like the city of Rayy.There is no worse torture than knowledge; alas for him whoremains in good and evil.Those women of Egypt in their unselfedness sufferedwounds and did not utter “Woe!”  The king in unselfedness on the night of Ascension traverseda road of a hundred thousand years.With the wind of selflessness break the prison of bone andsinew and tendon.io Shams-i Tabriz!, annihilate us, for you are as the sun and weare as the shadow.Do you know where you have come? From the midst of all-glorious sanctuary.Do you not remember at all those happy spiritual stages?Those things have become forgotten by you, so necessarilyyou are bewildered and distraught.You sell my soul for a handful of dust; what kind of bargainand sale is this? Give back the dust, and know your own worth; you are not aslave, you are a king, an emperor.For your sake there came out of heaven the fair-faced ones,the sweetly hidden.You who are imam oflove, say Allah Akbar, for you aredrunk; shake your two hands, become indifferent to exist-ence.You were fixed to a time, you made haste; the time of prayerhas come. Leap up — why are you seated?In hope of the qibla of God you carve a hundred qibla', inhope of that idol’s love you worship a hundred idols.Fly upwards, O soul, O obedient soul; the moon is above,the shadow is low. Do not like a beggar knock your hand at any door; knock atthe ring of the door of heaven, for you have a long arm.  Since the flagon of heaven has made you like that, be astranger to the world, tor you have escaped out of self.I say to you, “How are you?” No one ever says to the “how-less” soul, “How are you?”Tonight you are drunk and dissolute, come tomorrow andyou will see what bags you have torn, what glasses you havebroken.Every glass I have broken was my trust in you, tor myriad-wise you have bound up the broken. secret artist, in the depths of your soul you have a thousandforms, apart from the moon and the Lady of the Moon MahastI.If you have stolen the ring, you have opened a thousandthroats; if you have wounded a breast, you have given a hun-dred souls and hearts. have gone mad; whatever I say in madness, quickly say,“Yes, yes,” if you are privy to Alast.In the battle ranks we have no shield before our lace; in theconcert we are unaware of reed pipe and tambourine.We are naught in his love, dust at the foot of his love; we arelove fold upon fold, we are all love, nothing else.When we have obliterated ourselves we become altogetherlove; when surmeh is pounded, it is nothing but the source ofsight.Every body that has become an accident has become thesoul and heart of self-interest. Melt for of all sicknesses, there isnothing worse than being congealed.Out of desire of that melting and love for that cherishingthe liver within me has turned all to blood; I have no liver anymore.My heart is broken into a hundred pieces, my heart has be-come astray; today if you search, there is no trace of heart in me.  Look at the orb of the moon, waning every day, so that inthe dark period you might say there is no moon in the sky.The increasing leanness of that moon derives from nearnessto the sun; when afar, it is full-bodied, but such initiative doesnot belong to it.O king, for the sake of the souls send Venus as a minstrel;this soft pipe and tambourine are no match for the concert ofthe souls.No, no — for what is Venus when the Sun itself is powerless?To be suitable for such ardor is not in the power of any lute orsun.Yesterday you made compact and repentance, today youhave broken them; yesterday you were a bitter sea, today youare a pearl.Yesterday you were Ba Yazld and were augmenting; todayyou are in ruins, a dregs-seller and drunk.Drink the dregs, O soul! Break from reason, O soul! Do notwear blue, O soul, until you worship idols.Today you are very dissolute, you share the cup with the sun;You are not the master of the moon, nor the husband of thelady.You are greater than dwellings, you are outside mines; youare not that, but you are just as you are.One corner you were bound up, of that corner you weresick; you opened that which was bound and escaped wholly,escaped.A beast is not a rider, it is only for the sake of labor; you areno beast, you are a living man and you have leaped from labor,leaped.You are a heavenly messenger; how can you be like the moonuntil you ride aloft and are in the hand of the thumbstall?  Silence, give no sign, though you expressed everything; everywounded one you have wounded has become the salve of aworld.Minstrel, when you draw your plectrums over the strings,you draw into labor these idlers of the way.Love, when you enter, you draw these tarriers in the world ofseparation to the Beloved.Despite the highwaymen you make the world secure, youdrag to the gallows the thieves of the heart city.You see the cunning schemer, and cunningly blind him;when you see the friend, you draw him into the cave.You bind a golden saddle on the nimble-footed horses; theevil pack-horses you draw to the baggage.You cherish our melancholic ones every moment; ourmarket-minded ones you drag very miserably.To the thorn-enduring lovers you show the rose bower; youdraw into the thorns the self-willed whose joy is but tor a mo-ment.To him who enters the fire you give access to the water; hewho runs to water, you drag him into the flames.To Moses, dusty of face, you give the way to glory; Pharaoh,the seeker of pomp, you draw into disgrace.This reversed horseshoe acts without how and why; Mosesthe stick-seeker, you draw into a serpent.Yesterday I clutched his skirt saying, “O essence jewel ofgenerosity, do not say goodnight, do not grieve us, for tonightyou are mine.”  The darling face lit up and glowed red like a spark. He said,“That is enough; draw back. How long with this beggar’sways?”I said, “God’s Messenger said: ‘Seek your need of the hand-some, if you desire to attain it.’”He said, “The fair of face is self-willed and bad-tempered, forbeauty permits plenty of airs and wickedness.”I said, “If that is so, his wickedness is the life of thesoul, because whenever you try it, it is the talisman of themine . ”He said, “This is a raw talk; who is the handsome? This colorand form is a snare, it is cunning and inconstancy.“When a man possesses not the soul of the soul, know thathe possesses not that; many a man delivers his soul with theform of mortality.”I said, “Pretty of cheek, bring nonexistence into existence;change our copper to gold, you who are the soul of alchemy.“Copper must yield itself to discover the alchemy: you are agrain of corn, but you are outside the mill.”He said, “You are ungrateful, you are ignorant of copper;you are in doubt and conjecture from the things you show.”I began weeping wretchedly. I said, “You have the rule,come to the succor of your lover, O source oflight.”When he saw his servant’s tears he began to laugh; East andWest came to life through that grace and familiarity.Fellow travelers and friends, weep like a cloud, so that fairones may bring their sweet presence into the garden.Once again a melody has come from the reed pipe of for-tune; O soul, clap hands, O heart, stamp feet.A mine has become aglow, a world is laughing, a table isadorned, invitation is coming.  jWe are drunlc and roaring in hope of the spring over themeadow, adoring one of handsome cheek.He is the sun, we are a cloud; he the treasure, we a ruin; inthe light of a sea we are as motes. I am distracted, I am excused; suffer me to brag — with thelight of Mustafa I will split the moon.You who are weary of us, we are very desirous; you whohave withdrawn from the road, where is the courtesy of fellow-traveling?You are the marrow of the world, the rest is all hay; how shalla man get fat on eating hay?Every city which is ruined and turned upside down, that hashappened because it remained far from the royal shadow.When the sun has gone, what remains? Black night. Whenreason has gone from the head, what remains but idiocy? Reason, the riot that has befallen, all springs from your depart-ure: and then you attribute the fault to a body without reason.Wherever you turn your back, there is error and war; when-ever you show your face, there is drunkenness and stupefaction.The eighteen thousand worlds are of two divisionsonly — half dead, inanimate matter, and half conscious.The sea of consciousness from which all minds derive, that isthe goal of all finite minds.Swimming soul, who go in this sea, and you who leap fromthis wheel like an arrow —io By the tent of your body a world is illuminated; so how canyou be, you spirit of the tent!Spirit, eternity is intoxicated by your wine; in your hand,earth is transmuted to pure gold;Your description evades the understanding of the vulgar, in-comparable one, and transcends the likeness of the imaginationof one who likens you.  If any lover through yearning assigns a form to you, the seaof transcendence would not be made impure.If the babbling poets compare the crescent moon to a horse-shoe, the moon does not lose its moonliness.How could the sea remain a barrier in the path before Moses?And could the blind remain blind in the protection of Jesus?He is the master of all, even if he has not one slave; thatcypress of his is erect, even though you count it as not erect.You are Moses, though still the shepherd; you are Joseph,though still in the well.You do not receive the wages for labor because you are notalways engaged in this labor, but only casually.Silence, for without God’s food and wine from the unseenthese words and images are but two or three empty bowls.Bird-catcher, you have set a hidden snare; over the snare youhave laid smoke -colored fabric.Too many thousands of birds you have slain by this trick andlaid all the feathers plucked as a sign.The birds that are your watchmen make a great cry; whatmeanings you have planted in their cries!For the thirsty birds you have placed in the taverns of yourproximity vats of Magian wines.That vat, the scent of which neither saki nor drunkardcatches, you have laid down for the sake of the nightfarer thatyou know.In patience and penitence you have compounded the immu-nity of the shield; in cruelty and wrath you have set a lance.Without the danger of lance and shield, you have implantedfor the pious believers a kingdom in the seven oft-repeatedverses.Under the black of the eye you have made the wave of lightflow, and in that aged world you have set youthfulness.  In the breast which fashions forms out of imagination, youhave placed a finger without pen and finger,io Though so many veils of flesh and sinew lie over the heart,you have given the heart penetration and visible passage.Which is stranger — the glance that flies like an arrow, or thebrow you have set as a bow?Or that in vessel-like bodies you implanted various characterslike wines bitter and sweet,Or that this secret liquor distilled from the tongue you haveplaced on the tongue as the cream of speech?Every essence and accident is as a mouth-shut bud which youhave set as a veil over the cradle of virgins. On the day when you cause them to blossom and removethose veils, O soul of the soul of the soul, what soul you willhave implanted!Restless hearts will see for what reason in separation you haveplaced entreaty and yearning.Silence, that that soul may speak the spoken things; why haveyou implanted this long conjury?You swore an oath that henceforth you would be cruel; nowyou break your oath and finish with cruelty.Today we have seized your skirt and are drawing; how longwill you offer pretexts and cheat?Idol, that lip of yours is smiling and giving good tidings thatyou have resolved henceforward to be true .Since without you entreaty is not proper for us, what profitsit? It is only proper when you vouchsafe the need. Without your sea we flounder like fish on the land — so fishdo when you part them from water.The tyrant is cruel and the prisoner terrifies him with you;God does with you what you do in our case!  When you are cruel, with whom shall anyone terrify you?Only he who submits to whatever you demand.Silence, do not sell the unique pearl; how do you fix a pricefor that which is without value?Reed, very sweet it is that you know the secrets; that onedoes the work who has knowledge of the work.Reed, like the bulbul you are lamenting for the rose;do not scratch your neck, for you know the thornlessrose.I said to the reed, “You share the beloved’s breath; do notsteal the secret from me.” The reed said, “Knowledge is foryour total destruction.”I said, “My salvation is in my destruction; set fire, burn, donot leave knowledge.”He said, “How shall I be a brigand on this caravan? I knowthat knowledge is the leader.”I said, “Since the Beloved cherished not those gone astray,knowledge has become disgusted with itself.”You who are unaware of self, you have nine eyes; awareness isfor us the veil of eyes and sight.You are a companion of the lip because you have beenbeheaded; in this way head is a shame, and knowledge adisgrace.You have become empty of self and full of secrets becauseyou are aware of self- worshiping and unbelief.What lament, when you drink of the ruby lips of theBeloved? Let knowledge utter this bitter lament.No, no, you do not lament of yourself, noble one; weep forhim who is aware of others.If heaven laments, the ox is under the load; you are aware ofthis reversed deceptive horseshoe.  You who slay like sugar the lovers, slay my soul sweetly thismoment, if you are slaying.To slay sweetly and gently is the property of your hand, be-cause you slay with a glance he who seeks a glance.Every morning continuously I am waiting, waiting, becauseyou generally slay me at dawn.Your cruelty to us is candy; do not close the way to assis-tance. Is it not the case that at the end you will slay me in frontof the gate? You whose breath is without a belly, you whose sorrow re-pels sorrow, you who slay us in a breath like a spark,Every moment you proffer another repulse like a shield; youhave abandoned the sword and are slaying with the shield.Lion-heart, you have made a hundred thousand lion-hearts;you have outstripped the sun even in generosity.Close your eyes, and have compassion once more; break youroath, if you have sworn by God.See that these enemies are clapping their hands, since in thisrage and warlike mood you have stamped your foot.With whom is your inclination, O soul? — so that I may be-come his dust, so that I may become the servant of him whomyou have reckoned somebody. Body, at last stir yourself and make an effort. Effort isblessed; why are you languid?Rise, approach the friend; set your face to the earth, saying,“Idol sweet as sugar, by what are you vexed?”Master of the soul, Shams-i Din of Tabrizi, this head of mineis of your palm tree for it was nourished by you.  O soul, the breeze of spring is coming, so that you may raiseyour hand towards the rose garden.Grass and lily, tulip and hyacinth said, “There grows what-ever you sow.”Buds and rose blossoms came as a helmet so that the uglinessof the thorn may not appear.Elevation has come to the tall cypress, it has found gloryafter humiliation. Spirit enters all the garden, for water displays spirit-bestowing;The beauty of the garden increases from water — it has comeas most blessed friendship.Leaf has sent a message to fruit, “You come quickly, do notscratch your ear.”That sweet grape is king of the fruits, because its tree wasemaciated.In the winter of lust how long shall the garden of our heartremain imprisoned and walled in?io Seek the way from the heart, seek the moon from the soul;what does the earth possess but dust?Rise, wash your face, but with a water which beautifies thecheek of the rose.The branch of blossoms said to the basil, “Lay down what-ever you possess in our path.”The nightingale said to the garden, “We are the quarry ofyour snare.”The rose entreats God for mercy, “Do not put winter incommand over us.” God says, “How does juice come out of fruit until yousqueeze it?“Do not grieve over December and the raiding Ghuzz, andregard this business as lying at my door.  “Thanks and praise, joy and increase do not appear exceptyou lament.“I will give you life unnumbered if I take away numberedlife;“I will give you wine without hangover if I take away winethat yields hangover.”How many pictures hath knowledge, why do you go onpainting its pages?Through you the face of the pages has been blackened; howcan you read the writing of day?Have done with smoke; look at the light from the moon ofthe Beloved in the dark night.Enough, enough, come down from your horse, so that hemay ride forth, the horseman supreme.The Buraq of the love of realities carried away my mindand heart; ask me where it took them? Thither you do notknow.I reached that arch where I saw neither moon nor sky, thatworld where even world is parted from world.Give me respite for a moment for my mind to return tome; I will describe the soul to you — give ear, for you are thesoul.But approach nearer, my master, lay your ear on my mouth;for walls have ears, and this is a secret mystery.It is a loving care from the Beloved, this so strange a grace;the lamps of vision enter by way of the ear.Accompany the khidr of reason to the fountain of life, so thatlike the fountain of the sun by day you scatter light.As Zulaikha became young through the intention of Joseph,so the ancient world recovers its youth from this star.The Canopus of the soul swallows moon, sun and pole of theseven skies when he rises from the Yemeni pillar.  Take for a moment a clipping of faith and place it underyour tongue that you may see how inwardly you are a mine ofgold!You have fallen into the mouths and men are chewing you;since you are a fine and well-baked bread, you are always thesame.You dance like a mote when light takes your hand; it is out ofcoldness and wetness that you are heavy as sand.When the sun rises it says to the dark earth, “Since I becameyour companion, you are a master of double conjunction.”You are not a goat to come and play the rearing horse; youare a shepherd like a raging lion before the herd of lions.Light up the five lamps of your senses with the light of theheart; the senses are as the five prayers, the heart like the sevenoft-repeated verses.Every dawn a cry comes out of the heavens, “When you set-tle the dust of the road, you lead the way to a sign.”So draw not back the reins of resolution like ahermaphrodite; ahead of you are two armies toward which youadvance like a lance.Sugar has come to you, saying, “Open your mouth”; whyhave you closed your mouth like a pistachio to the sugar’s invi-tation?Take the bowl of sugar; eat by the bowlful — may you enjoyit! Do not beat the drum of legend — why do you give in to thetongue?Through Shams, Pride of Tabriz, you worship the sun, for heis the sun of spiritual sciences, the governor of the sun of place.You are my heaven, I am the earth in astonishment; everymoment what things have you set growing in my heart.I am the dry-lipped earth; rain that water of grace. Of yourwater earth discovers rose and rose garden.  What does the earth know, what have you sown in its heart?It is pregnant by you, and you know what it is bearing.Every atom is pregnant by you with another mystery; for awhile you writhe with the pregnant women in agony.What things are in the womb of this enfolded earth fromwhich are born “I am the truth” and the cry “Glory to me!”Now it groans, and a camel is born of its womb; a staff fallsand takes the way of serpenthood.The prophet said, “Know the believer is like a camel, alwaysdrunk with God who looks after his camel.“Now he brands him, and now sets provender before him;now he binds his knees with the shackle of reason,“And now he loosens his knees to dance like a camel, to rendasunder the bridle and go in disarray.”See how the meadow can not contain itself for joy, since thespiritual garden has given it so many forms.See the power of the Universal Soul to impart understanding,so that through it the dullard earth has become a spiritual shaper.Like the Universal Soul, the whole plenum is a veil or curtainof the Sun of Majesty who has no second,The eternal Sun which never sets, the light of whose face isneither of the Aquarius nor of Libra.One by one all that He sowed is appearing. Silence, for theoyster shells are pregnant with the divine pearls.The lord of beauty and quintessence ofloveliness entered thesoul and mind as a man will stroll in the garden at spring.Come, come, for you are the life and salvation of men; come,come, for you are the eye and lamp of Jacob.Lay foot on my water and clay, for through your foot dark-ness and veiledness depart from water and clay.Through your glow stones turn to rubies, through yoursearching the searcher reaches his goal.  Come, come, for you bestow beauty and glory; come, come,for you are the cure of a thousand Jobs.Come, come, though you have never departed, but I speakevery word to you for a desired end.Sit in the place of my soul, for you are a thousand times mysoul; slay your paramour and lover, for you are the Beloved.If the king is not the king of the world, O melancholy world,by His life I bid you say, “Why are you in confusion?”Now you are gay and fresh with His green banner, and nowyou are overturned by the heart of His army of battle.Now, like the thought of an artist, you fashion forms; nowyou sweep carpets like the broom of the porter.When you sweep a form, you give its quintessence angel-hood, and the wings and pinions of the cherubim.Silence, guard the water strictly like a waterbag, for if yousprinkle it through a crack, know that you are at fault.Your heart has reached Shams, the Pride of Tabriz, becausethe Duldul of the heart proved itself a nimble mount.Finally you have broken away and departed into the Unseen;I wonder, I wonder — by which way did you depart from theworld?You beat your feathers and wings mightily and broke yourcage; you took the air and departed towards the spiritualworld.You were a special falcon in captivity to an old woman; whenyou heard the falcon-drum, you departed to the placeless.You were a drunken nightingale amongst owls; the scent ofthe rose garden arrived, you departed to the rose garden.You suffered much crop sickness from this sour ferment;finally you departed to the eternal tavern.You went straight as an arrow to the target of bliss; you flewto that target and departed from this bow.  This world like a ghoul gave you false clues; you took noheed of the clue and departed to the clueless.Since you have become the sun, what have you to do with acrown? Since you have departed from the middle, why do youseek a belt?I have heard tell of gazing on the soul when the eyes are ex-tinguished; why do you gaze on the soul, since you have de-parted to the soul of soul?O heart, what a rare bird you are, that in hunting tor the All-Grateful you departed towards the lance with two wings like ashield.The rose flees from autumn; ah, what a bold rose you are,that you went creeping along before the autumn wind.Like rain from heaven on the roof of the earthly world youran in every direction and departed by the spout.Be silent, suffer not the anguish of speech; sleep on, for youhave departed into the shelter of such a loving friend.Come, come, for you will not find another friend like me;where indeed in both worlds is a beloved like me?Come, come, and do not pass your days in every direction,for there is no other market elsewhere for your money.You are like a dry water conduit and I am like the rain; youare like a ruined city and I am like the architect.Except in serving me, which is the sunrise of joy, men havenever seen and never will see any mark of happiness.In sleep you see a thousand moving forms; when sleep hasgone, you see not a single creature.Close the eye of wrong and open the eye of intelligence, forthe carnal soul has fallen like an ass, and concupiscence is thehalter.Seek sweet syrup from the garden oflove, for human natureis a vinegar-seller and a crusher of unripe grapes.  Come to the hospital of your Creator, tor no sick man cando without that physician.The world without that king is like the body without itshead; wind round such a head as a turban,io If you are not black, let not the mirror go from your hand;for the soul is your mirror and the body is rust.Where is the lucky merchant with Jupiter in ascension, that Imay do that business with him and purchase his goods?Come, think of me who gave you thought; if you are buyingrubies, at least buy from my mine.Go on foot towards him who gave you a foot, gaze on himwith both eyes who gave you sight.Clap hands for joy for him from whose sea is the foam, forthere is no grief or sorrow happening to him. Listen without ears; speak unto him without a tongue, forthe speech of the tongue is not without contradiction and in-jury.If you have no beloved, why do you not seek one? And if youhave attained the Beloved, why do you not rejoice?If the companion is not compliant, why do you not becomehim? If the rebec wails not, why do you not teach it manners?If an Abu Jahl is a veil to you, why do you not attack AbuJahl and Abu Lahab?You sit idly saying, “This is a strange business”; you are thestrange one not to desire such a strange one. You are the sun of the world; why are you black at heart? Seethat you do not any more have a desire for the knot of Draco.Like gold you are prisoner in the furnace so that you may notbe covetous of the purse of gold.Since Unity is the bachelor’s chamber of those who say“One,” why do you not make your spirit a bachelor to all butGod?  Have you ever seen Majnun have affection with two LailTs?Why not desire only one face and one chin?There is such a moon in hiding in the night of your being;why do you not pray and petition at midnight?Though you are an ancient drunkard and not new to thewine, God’s wine does not suffer you not to make turmoil.My wine is the fire oflove, especially from the hand of God;may life be unlawful to you, since you do not make your lifefirewood.Though the wave of discourse is surging, yet it is better thatyou should expound it with heart and soul, not with lips.Heart, you are the phoenix of union. Fly, why do you notfly? No one recognizes you, neither man nor peri.You are the sweetheart, not the heart; but with every deviceand trickery you have taken the shape of the heart so that youwill ravish a thousand hearts.For a moment faithfully you mingle with earth, and for amoment you pass beyond empyrean and firmament and thebounds of the two worlds.Why does not spirit find you, for you are its wings andfeathers? Why does not sight see you who are the source ofsight?What power has penitence to repent of you? What isconsciousness that it should remain conscious along withyou?What shall be that poor copper when the alchemy comes?Will it not pass away from copperhood into the attribute ofgold?Who is that poor seed when the springtime comes? Does notits seedhood pass away into treehood?Who is poor brushwood when it falls into the fire? Is not thebrushwood transformed into a spark by the flame?  All reason and science are stars; are you the sun of the worldwho tear asunder their veils?The world is like snow and ice, and you are the season ofsummer; when you, king, are on its track, no trace of it remains.Say, who am I to remain along with you? I and a hundredlike me will pass away when you gaze towards me.The perfection of the description of the lord Shams-i Tabriz!surpasses the imaginations of predestinator and free-wilier.We have come once again to a lord to whose knee no seareaches.Tie together a thousand minds, they will not reach Him;how shall a hand or foot reach the moon in heaven?The sky stretched out its throat eagerly to Him; it found nokiss, but it swallowed a sweetmeat.A thousand throats and gullets stretched towards His lip.“Scatter too on our heads manna and quails.”We have come again to a Beloved, from whose air a shouthas reached our ears.We have come again to that sanctuary to bow the browwhich is to surpass the skies.We have come again to that meadow to whose bolbol ‘anqais a slave.We have come to Him who was never apart from us; forthe waterbag is never filled without the existence of a water-carrier.The bag always clings to the body of the water-carrier,saying, “Without you, I have no hand or knowledge or opin-ion.”We have come again to that feast with the sweet dessert ofwhich the sugarcane chewer attained his desire.We have come again to that sphere, in whose bent the soulroars like thunder.  We have come again to that love at whose contact the div hasbecome peri-lilce.Silence! Seal the rest under your tongue, tor a jealous tutorhas been put in charge of you.Speak not of the talk of the Pride of Tabriz, Shams-i Din, torthe rational mind is not suitable tor that speech.Leap, leap from the world, that you may be king of theworld; seize the sugar tray that you may be a sugar plantation.Leap, leap like a meteor to slay the div; when you leap out ofstardom, you will be the pole of heaven.When Noah sets out for the sea, you will be his ship; whenthe Messiah goes to heaven, you will be the ladder.Now like Jesus of Mary you become the soul’s physician; andnow like Moses of ‘Emran you will go forth to be a shepherd.There is a spiritual fire for the sake of cooking you; if youleap back like a woman, you will be a raw cuckold.If you do not flee from the fire, and become wholly cookedlike well-baked bread, you will be a master and lord of the table.When you come to the table and the brethren receive you,like bread you will be sustenance of the soul and you will be thesoul.Though you are the mine of pain, by patience you will be-come the treasure; though you are a flawed house, you will be aknower of the unseen.I said this, and a call came from heaven to my spirit’s ear say-ing, “If you become like this, you will be like that.”Silence! the mouth is intended for cracking sugar, not foryou to cast slack and become a chin-wagger.
